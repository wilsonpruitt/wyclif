# TRANSLATOR CARD — one *De potestate pape* chunk

This card replaces reading CONVENTIONS, the pilot and Thakkar in full: it is their working core.
Adapted from `chunks/ecclesia/CARD.md` (2026-10-07), with its close-out lessons written in. Read it, then `GLOSSARY.md`, then your
scaffold (or your brief, which carries all three). Consult CONVENTIONS.md only when the card sends
you there. Work in `~/wyclif`. Wyclif is approached with **daggers drawn**: the most recent English
versions were "worse than useless" because of four error classes (below). Your English must survive
a hostile reader with the Latin open.

## Work lean (cost is per tool call: each call re-sends your whole context)

1. One call reading what you need (the brief, or CARD + GLOSSARY + scaffold).
2. **One** `bible.py` call with every scripture reference you need (it takes many refs).
3. Plates **only** for a Latin doubt the print plus apparatus cannot settle.
4. Write each finished chunk in **one** Write of the whole file (Latin blocks copied unchanged).
5. Lint once; fix; done. Draft in your head, not in the file.

## The volume

*Tractatus de potestate pape*, ed. Johann Loserth (Wyclif Society, 1907), from the plates of archive.org
`latinworks19wycl` (**leaf = page + 61**). Written 1379 (Loserth), after *De ecclesia* and *De veritate
sacre scripture*, both of which it cites ("libri proximi" at 1.7 is the editor's crux: he takes the
nearest book to be *De officio regis*). A **treatise** in twelve chapters: Wyclif speaks in the first
person, states conclusions, raises objections (*instatur*, *obicitur*, *arguitur*) and answers them.
Its subject is power (*potestas*), what it is and how it is divided, then the papal power: Peter's
primacy, the pope as Christ's vicar, the election of a pope, the "Caesarean" pope and the endowment,
and Antichrist. **Richard FitzRalph** (*dominus Ardmacanus*, "the lord of Armagh"; *Summa in quaestionibus
Armenorum*) is a constant partner, quoted and answered. Pp. 398–406 are a medieval **compendium**
(*Sentencia libri … in compendio*), a summary of the chapters that came down with the work: translate it
like the text.

**Sigla** (Loserth): **A** Prague, Metropolitan Chapter C 73 (his base, "well-preserved", a copy made
"by a man of learning and ability"); **B** Prague, University Library III F 11 (early 15th c.; Loserth
argues A and B are closely related and A cannot have been copied from B); **C** Prague Univ. XI E 3,
variants only near the end (the *Protestationes* extract). Both A and B carry marginal notes, which
Loserth prints ("A in marg.: …", "B in marg.: …"); A's copyist was a Catholic reader who annotates
against Wyclif ("Cave … contradicit sibi"). Cite variants with these sigla.

**The page foot** (in your brief as "apparatus", by page) has two blocks, both keyed to the line:
the variants (`27, 28. B: et aliqua potencia est creata deest.`) and Loserth's source references (`27. Decret. Unam sanctam.
Extrav. comm. lib. I, tit. VIII, cap. I.`). The OCR of it is rough: read it for sense, not letter by letter.

## The job

The Latin in your scaffold is **established and frozen** (three-witness vote + plate reading). Fill
`[TITLE]` (short, lower case: "headship: the pope is not head of the church"), each `[ENGLISH]`, the
notes and the transcription notes; set `status: translated`; lint; report.

- **Headings:** keep `## ¶k · range` exactly. **Never change a range; never split a paragraph.**
  (The pilot headed its paragraphs with Loserth's alinea letters A, B, C; the scaffolds do not
  carry them, so leave the ¶ numbers.)
- **Never alter the Latin.** A word that looks wrong: read the apparatus for that line first; then,
  if still doubtful, the plate (`text/potestate-pape/raw/leaves/nLEAF.jpg`, LEAF = page + 61 padded to four digits: p. 1 = `n0062.jpg`;
  ⚠ **p. 266** is faded blank in that scan: use `https://archive.org/download/tractatusdepotes00wycl/page/n327.jpg`). A variant
  that gives the sense → translate it + **T** note citing the siglum; a compelling emendation →
  translate it + **T** note "(our emendation)"; neither → translate the print and flag it. Never
  smooth nonsense into sense. Report every such case. **Loserth's printed text governs** (ruled
  2026-10-02): translate it, his own emendations included, unless it will not construe; a manuscript
  reading is chosen only then, and a single manuscript's reading never outweighs the print without cause; every departure gets a T note
  giving both readings. Open flags for this volume:
  `text/potestate-pape/PLATE-FLAGS.md` (read it if it exists and your pages are listed there).
- **English layout:** `[N]` at the same word as `[p. N]` in the Latin (the chunk's first `[p. N]` is
  implicit). Supplied words in `[brackets]`, sparingly. **Quotations** in quotation marks. Your brief
  carries Loserth's **italic runs** per page (from the scan's OCR; a side-note can split one run in two,
  and an apparatus phrase occasionally slips in). They are the editor's judgement of where a quotation
  runs, not the manuscript's: follow them by default, depart where the source shows otherwise (say so in
  a note). Reviews do not check quotation bounds against the italics.
- **Formulae of the disputation** (GLOSSARY §C, ruled 2026-10-01), rendered the same way throughout: *instatur* "it is objected" ·
  *obicitur* "it is objected" · *arguitur* "it is argued" (with *per*: GLOSSARY) · *dicitur* "it is
  said" (in an answer: "the answer is") · *respondetur* "the reply is" · *conclusio* "conclusion" ·
  *antecedens / consequens* "antecedent / consequent" · *consequencia* "inference", ⛔ never
  "consequence" (GLOSSARY §C).

## The four error classes (Thakkar) — check every sentence

1. **Terms:** GLOSSARY.md governs, one term one rendering. Tag the **first occurrence in the chunk**
   of every §A–C term: `[quiddity]{g:quiditas}`. The key must exist in GLOSSARY.md. A term that looks
   technical but has no row: render it sensibly, untagged, and propose it in your report.
   **CONTEXTUAL** rows hold two senses English splits: choose by context and write a **C** note at
   the first occurrence in the chunk and wherever it leans to the other sense (the dikaiosune rule,
   CONVENTIONS §6).
   Key rulings carried from *De ecclesia*: *ecclesia* church (**lower-case**) · *caput* head ·
   *membrum* member · *predestinati* the predestinate · *presciti* the foreknown · *papa* pope ·
   *vicarius Christi* vicar of Christ · *caritas* charity (never love) · *dominium* lordship · *viator*
   wayfarer · *ex fide* as faith teaches · *sentencia* teaching (the rest: GLOSSARY).
   ⚠ **This volume's own term is *potestas*** and its kin (*potencia*, *auctoritas*, *iurisdiccio*,
   *primatus*, *dotacio*, *papa cesareus*): check GLOSSARY for each; where it has no row, render
   consistently within your brief and PROPOSE the row (the coordinator rules between briefs). Keep
   *potestas* "power" and *potencia* distinct in the English wherever Wyclif distinguishes them (ch. 1
   sets them side by side).
2. **Connectives carry the argument.** ⛔ Never omit one, never turn one into filler.

   | Latin | English | Never |
   |---|---|---|
   | enim, nam | for | "now", "indeed" |
   | ergo, igitur, ideo | therefore, so, then | "now", "and", "indeed" |
   | sed / autem, marking the **minor premiss or next step** | now | (omitted) |
   | sed / autem, adversative | but | (omitted) |
   | autem, continuative | and | (omitted), and **not "now"** |
   | cum (concessive / causal) | although / since | "whenever" |
   | tamen | yet, nevertheless | "therefore" |
   | item | again, also | "now" |
   | per idem | by the same token | "in the same way" |
   | ymmo | indeed, rather (correcting upward) | (omitted) |
   | patet; constat | it is clear; it is evident | |

   "Now" is reserved for the minor premiss, or the step that brings a new premiss to bear (*Illos
   autem parentes debemus …*, 1.17). An *autem* that only extends the same step is "and" (*Illis autem
   cultis …*, 1.19). ⚠ The commonest error in *De ecclesia* (close-out, ~50 of 69 connective fixes): a
   *sed* that brings the minor premiss of a syllogism closed by *ergo / ideo / igitur* rendered "but".
   Before writing "but" for a *sed*, look ahead for the *ergo*: if one follows, it is "now".
3. **Ordinary words with a medieval sense:** GLOSSARY §D; look up any word whose classical and
   Wyclifite senses may differ, and propose additions.
4. **Syntax:** construe before rendering (main verb, subject, what every relative and genitive
   hangs on). Keep quantifier order where it is meaning (*nullus papa … caput*; *quilibet papa*).
   Keep Wyclif's long periods where English tolerates them. **A doubtful construal is never chosen
   silently:** translate the likelier reading and write a **C** note giving the alternative.

## Scripture

`python3 scripts/w3/bible.py "Luc 17:23"` (Vulgate + Douay–Rheims; psalms in Vulgate numbering) or
`python3 scripts/w3/bible.py --find "nolite ire neque sectemini"`. Where Wyclif's Latin agrees with the
Clementine Vulgate, use the **Douay–Rheims wording**. Where he departs, translate *his* Latin and write
an **S** note giving the Vulgate. Modern references in the English (Luke 17:23). The chapter numbers
are Wyclif's, the verse numbers Loserth's (the headnote says so once).

## Notes

- `[^n]` from 1, the marker placed in the same edit as its note, each opening with a type letter:
  **T** text · **C** construal · **G** glossary (passage-specific only; otherwise a tag) · **S** source ·
  **R** reception/context (e.g. a B marginal gloss that shows how an early reader construed the text,
  CONVENTIONS §4; Hus's reuse where Loserth notes it, e.g. "Hus, fol. 21b" in the apparatus).
- **Density: about one note per 70–100 Latin words**, fewer where the text is plain. Short, factual,
  says what the Latin does and stops. No modern theology, no evaluation.
- **Every identification** other than scripture checked with bible.py gets a ledger row in your
  report with a status: `editor` (Loserth's source reference at the page foot), `to-verify` (from
  memory: every patristic or canon-law identification you did not read in this session), `verified`
  (you read the source text this session: say where; local PL at `~/patrologia/sources/pl/tei/`).
  ⛔ Never pass memory off as verified. Id `P<chunk>-<n>` (`P02a-1`), cited in the note:
  "(LEDGER P02a-1)". FitzRalph: cite book and chapter of the *Summa in quaestionibus Armenorum* as
  Loserth gives them (he often says "mihi ad manum non est", i.e. he could not check: then `to-verify`). Loserth's references to the *Corpus iuris canonici* (Decretum, Extravagantes)
  are `editor`; give them in modern form (*Extrav. comm.* 1.8.1) and say the form is ours.

## Model of register

`pilots/wyc-ecclesia-01a.md` (De ecclesia pp. 1–5) is a reviewed model of register and note style:
read it for that only (it predates some GLOSSARY rulings; **GLOSSARY governs**). **Chunk 01-a** fills
`## Headnote` (work, date, editor, sigla, the compendium), marking each unverified claim `[verify]`.

## Side-notes

Already read against the plates (WORKFLOW 5, `text/potestate-pape/sidenotes.fixed.tsv`) and
placed in your scaffold's section. ⛔ Do not edit them. One that is plainly wrong (garbled, or at
the wrong line): report it under Latin doubts as `side-note page.line`.

## Finish

1. `status: translated` in the front matter (nothing else changes there).
2. `.venv/bin/python scripts/w3/lint.py chunks/potestate-pape/<your chunk>.md` until clean.
3. The four-class check above, sentence by sentence.
4. ⛔ Edit **only your chunk(s)**. No git, no other files. Everything shared goes in your report.

## Report (≤ 200 words per chunk, exactly these heads)

- **Chunk:** id, Latin words, notes.
- **Ledger rows:** in LEDGER.md's table format `| id | chunk / note | claim | status | how / next step |`.
- **Glossary proposals:** Latin · proposed English · where · why.
- **Latin doubts:** page.line · printed · suspicion · settled on the plate?
