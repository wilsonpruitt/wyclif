# Translation brief: eucharistia 06-f–06-h

You translate these 3 chunk(s) of Wyclif's *Tractatus de eucharistia* in a single pass. Everything you need is in this file:
the working card, the glossary rows these chunks use, and for each chunk its scaffold and the editor's
apparatus for its pages. Work so as to use few tool calls:

1. Read this brief once (it is the only file you need to read, unless the card names one for your chunk).
2. For each chunk, write the COMPLETE chunk file ONCE with the Write tool to its path (given in the chunk's
   header below): the scaffold with `status: translated`, the title, the English after every Latin block,
   headings and side-notes as the card says, Notes, and Transcription notes, in the card's
   layout. Never alter the Latin. Do not make a series of small edits.
3. Use the apparatus given here for variants (the card's rule: a variant that gives the sense is translated
   with a T note citing the siglum; otherwise translate the print and flag it). Open a plate image only if a
   word cannot be construed at all from the print plus the apparatus; otherwise flag it as a Latin doubt.
4. Scripture: quote the Douay-Rheims as you know it. At the END, check every reference you quoted in ONE
   command: `cd /Users/wilsonpruitt/wyclif && .venv/bin/python scripts/w3/bible.py "Ref 1" "Ref 2" ...` and fix any wording
   that differs, in the same chunk file (this is the one allowed round of edits).
5. Run `cd /Users/wilsonpruitt/wyclif && .venv/bin/python scripts/w3/lint.py chunks/eucharistia/wyc-eucharistia-06-f.md chunks/eucharistia/wyc-eucharistia-06-g.md chunks/eucharistia/wyc-eucharistia-06-h.md` once and fix what it reports.
6. Final message: per chunk, the ledger rows (table: id | chunk / note | claim | status | how / next step),
   glossary proposals, Latin doubts, and a one-line note of anything the coordinator must decide.

Standing rules (from the *De ecclesia* briefs, 2026-10-02):
- Do NOT search the Patrologia or other sources; a separate checker verifies them afterwards. Give the
  editor's reference, the modern form in the English, and "to be checked" with a fresh LEDGER id per item
  (never reuse an id).
- Notes open with their bold class codes, `**S/C.**`, never bare letters mid-note. No process words in
  the notes ("the report", "the coordinator", "brief").
- OCR scars (stray English or margin letters, line numbers read as words, glued or broken words,
  numerals read as letters) stay out of the chunk: translate the print's word and list each scar in your
  final message only (page.line, token, likely print reading). The coordinator fixes the Latin.
- Flag every place the established Latin may have LOST a word (it does not construe, especially at a page
  head or foot) or DOUBLED one: page.line and the suspicion. Translate the print as it stands; supply a
  missing word only in brackets with a T note. The editor's print governs; list any departure.


## The working card

# TRANSLATOR CARD — one *De eucharistia* chunk

This card replaces reading CONVENTIONS, the pilot and Thakkar in full: it is their working core.
Adapted from `chunks/potestate-pape/CARD.md` (Loserth's other volume) with the B+ lessons of
`chunks/incarnacione/CARD.md` (2026-11-06; **reviewed 2026-11-06** on `prol-a`: `_review/REVIEW-prol-a.md`). Read it, then `GLOSSARY.md`,
then your scaffold (or your brief, which carries all three). Consult CONVENTIONS.md only when the card sends
you there. Work in `~/wyclif`. Wyclif is approached with **daggers drawn**: the most recent English
versions were "worse than useless" because of four error classes (below). Your English must survive
a hostile reader with the Latin open.

## Work lean (cost is per tool call: each call re-sends your whole context)

1. One call reading what you need (the brief, or CARD + GLOSSARY + scaffold).
2. **One** `bible.py` call with every scripture reference you need (it takes many refs).
3. Plates **only** for a Latin doubt the print plus apparatus cannot settle.
4. Write each finished chunk in **one** Write of the whole file (Latin blocks copied unchanged).
5. Lint once; fix; done. Draft in your head, not in the file.

## The volume

*Tractatus de eucharistia* and *Tractatus de penitencia sive de confessione*, ed. Johann Loserth (Wyclif
Society, 1892), from the plates of archive.org `latinworks13wycl` (**leaf = page + 71**; leaf images in
`text/eucharistia/raw/leaves/`). Three texts:

Chunk ids: `prol-a … prol-c` the compendium, `01-a … 09-n` the nine chapters, `pen01 … pen06` *De
penitencia*, `quest` the *Questio*.

- **pp. 1–10, the compendium** (*Sentencia tractatus de Eukaristia in compendio*, under "Prologus"): a
  medieval summary of the nine chapters that came down with the work. Translate it like the text.
- **pp. 11–326, the *Tractatus de eucharistia* (maior)**, nine long chapters. Written in Wyclif's last
  years, before 1382–83 (Loserth, Introd. §4: it shares passages word for word with *Sermones* III, and
  it avoids the words *substancia* and *materialis* of the bread, which Wyclif says in *Sermo* III.54 he
  has stopped using). Wyclif's case against the "modern" doctrine: that the consecrated host is in its
  nature bread and wine and sacramentally, figuratively, the body and blood of Christ; that an accident
  without a subject is impossible; that the decree *Ego Berengarius* (*De cons.* D. 2 c. 42) is the
  faith of the ancient Roman church; against the friars, Thomas, Scotus and "the sect of the signs".
  A **treatise**: Wyclif speaks in the first person, states conclusions, raises objections and answers
  them. The tractatus minor (the *Confessio*) is NOT in this volume (Shirley, *Fasc. Ziz.*).
- **pp. 327–348, *De eucharistia et penitencia sive de confessione*** in six chapters (only ch. 1 is on
  the eucharist; the rest is penance and auricular confession), then the short ***Questio ad fratres de
  sacramento altaris*** (pp. 347–348, its first part only: Loserth notes that the rest of the
  manuscript's text is not on the sacrament, and is Hus's).

**Sigla. ⚠ They differ between the two works.** *De eucharistia* (Introd. §5): **A** Vienna 3927;
**B** Vienna 3932; **C** Vienna 1387 ("the best of the three" Vienna MSS, correcting A and B); **D** Prague
Univ. IV D 22 (1404–05, Andreas of Kouřim); **E** Prague Univ. XI E 3 (1460; Loserth: "the best and most
reliable text of all the five"). Loserth's lettering "does not in any way refer to their respective
value". The Vienna MSS are one group, the Prague MSS another. *De penitencia* (Introd. §6): **A** Vienna
3927; **B** Bautzen, Gersdorf Library M. St. 80.7; **C** Vienna 1337; **D** Prague Univ. III G 11; **E**
Vienna 3980; **F** Vienna 4527. Cite variants with the sigla of the work you are in. Marginal notes in the
manuscripts that Loserth prints ("F in marg.", "DB in marg.") are reception: an **R** note where they
show how a reader took the text.

**The page foot** (in your brief as "apparatus", by page) has two blocks, both keyed to the **line**:
the variants (`19. C: ecclesie in marg. alia manu.`) and Loserth's source references. The OCR of it is
rough: read it for sense, not letter by letter, and read the plate foot where a variant matters.

## The job

The Latin in your scaffold is **established and frozen** (blind transcription of the plates, checked word
by word against a four-scan vote; residue read on the plate). Fill `[TITLE]` (short, lower case: "the
three opinions on the quiddity of the host"), each `[ENGLISH]`, the notes and the transcription notes;
set `status: translated`; lint; report.

- **Headings:** keep `## ¶k · range` exactly. **Never change a range; never split a paragraph.**
- **Never alter the Latin.** A transcription error you find (a stray mark, a broken word, a side-note
  word in the text) is REPORTED, never repaired in your file: the coordinator repairs the transcription
  (`text/eucharistia/bt/pNNN.txt`) and refreshes the chunk's Latin. A word that looks wrong: read the
  apparatus for that line first; then, if still doubtful, the plate (`text/eucharistia/raw/leaves/nLEAF.jpg`,
  LEAF = page + 71 padded to four digits: p. 1 = `n0072.jpg`). A variant that gives the sense → translate
  it + **T** note citing the siglum; a compelling emendation → translate it + **T** note "(our
  emendation)"; neither → translate the print and flag it. Never smooth nonsense into sense. Report every
  such case. **Loserth's printed text governs** (ruled 2026-10-02 for Loserth's volumes; the
  manuscripts-outrank-the-print rule is Harris's volumes only): translate it, his own emendations
  included, unless it will not construe; a manuscript reading is chosen only then, or where the source
  Wyclif quotes, read this session, agrees with it. Every departure gets a T note giving both readings.
- **The compendia (`prol-a … prol-c`) summarise chapters whose Latin is already established** in this
  directory. Where the compendium's ellipsis leaves a construal open (whose argument, which *per* phrase is a
  ground and which a means), grep the chapter's `>` blocks, follow them, and cite the page in the **C** note:
  that is construal, not source verification, and one call. (`prol-a` 2.1–5: the three decrees are the
  objections' grounds, ch. 1 pp. 24, 25, 28.)
- **English layout:** `[N]` at the same word as `[p. N]` in the Latin (the chunk's first `[p. N]` is
  implicit). Supplied words in `[brackets]`, sparingly, ⛔ never in italics. **Quotations** (a quotation running on across ¶s or into the next chunk opens each ¶ with a double quote and closes only at its end; quotations inside it take single quotes) in quotation
  marks. Your brief carries Loserth's **italic runs** per page where the scan's OCR gives them (rough;
  ⚠ page numbers drift: a run not in your page's Latin belongs to a neighbouring page): they are
  the editor's judgement of where a quotation runs, not the manuscript's: follow them by default, depart
  where the source shows otherwise (say so in a note). Reviews do not check quotation bounds against the
  italics. Italicised scripture inside indirect speech is quoted too; where quoting would garble the
  sentence, leave it unquoted and give the reference in an **S** note.
- **Ordinals:** a degree-sign ordinal can print or OCR like a two-digit number (*30 et 10* = 3° and 1°).
  Read both forms the same way, and check the plate when a citation looks impossible.
- **Formulae of the disputation** (ruled 2026-10-01; fixed renderings, tagged only where GLOSSARY has a
  row): *instatur* "it is objected" · *obicitur* "it is objected" · *arguitur* "it is argued" (with
  *per*: GLOSSARY) · *dicitur* "it is said" (in an answer: "the answer is") · *respondetur* "the reply is"
  · *conclusio* "conclusion" · *antecedens / consequens* "antecedent / consequent" · *consequencia*
  "inference", ⛔ never "consequence" · *patet* "it is clear" · *supponitur* "it is supposed" ·
  *probatur* "proof:" or "it is proved" · *confirmatur* "this is confirmed" · *solvit / dissolvit* (an objection) "resolves", both (never "answers", which belongs to *respondetur / dicitur*).
- **A source note says only what the Latin says about the source** (who narrates, which book, which work)
  and leaves the rest to the ledger: never supply a story the Latin rules out (*narratum a beato Gregorio*:
  Gregory narrates).
- **Citation formulae:** *ubi supra* "in the place cited above" (⛔ never a claim about where a passage
  stands), *ut supra* "as above", *infra* "below". *Utrobique* "on both sides / in both places".

## The four error classes (Thakkar) — check every sentence

1. **Terms:** GLOSSARY.md governs, one term one rendering. Tag the **first occurrence in the chunk** of
   every §A–C term: `[accident]{g:accidens}`; a multi-word key is lower case with hyphens, `{g:corpus-christi}`, `{g:a-simili}` (lint rejects spaces); never nest brackets inside a tag (`[form [sounds] with]{g:k}` breaks the site): tag the bare word. The key must exist in GLOSSARY.md. A term that looks
   technical but has no row: render it sensibly, untagged, and propose it in your report.
   **CONTEXTUAL** rows hold two senses English splits: choose by context and write a **C** note at the
   first occurrence in the chunk and wherever it leans to the other sense (the dikaiosune rule,
   CONVENTIONS §6).
   Rows that already exist and bear on this volume: *accidens* "accident" · *accidens absolutum*
   "absolute accident" · *transsubstanciacio* "transubstantiation" · *conficere* "consecrate (the
   eucharist)" · *figura / figuratum* "figure / thing figured" · *res sacramenti* "reality of the
   sacrament" · *sacramentalia* "sacramentals" · *quantus* "quantified" · *per se / per accidens* "of
   itself / by accident" · *sensibile commune* "common sensible" · *ecclesia* church (**lower-case**) ·
   *caritas* charity · *sentencia* teaching (and *sentencia verborum* "sense", a separate row) · *ex fide* as faith teaches ·
   *opinio* opinion · *novelli* the newer [doctors] · *sancti* the saints · *concludere* infer ("conclude" only where a
   conclusion is literally drawn) · *deduccio* deduction · *maneries* kind · *principaliter* as a main head ·
   *sensibilis* perceptible · *declarare / ostendere* make clear / show · *ecclesia* is tagged at its first
   occurrence in every chunk.
   **This volume's vocabulary is now ruled (2026-11-06, `prol-a` review):** *sacramentum* (the eucharist) ·
   *hostia* host · *panis / vinum* bread / wine · *calix* chalice · *corpus Christi / Domini* kept apart ·
   *remanencia* the remaining · *accidens sine subiecto* · *substancia · quantitas · qualitas* · *esse /
   esse sacramentale* being / sacramental being · *esus / manducacio* eating · *confeccio* consecration ·
   *secta signorum* · *novella / antiqua ecclesia* · *predicacio ydemptica / tropica* identical / tropical
   predication. **The mode adverbs, one word each, never merged, each tagged at first occurrence:**
   *sacramentaliter* sacramentally · *realiter* really (never "actually") · *vere* truly (never "really") ·
   *spiritualiter* spiritually · *virtualiter* virtually · *figurative* figuratively · *tropice* tropically ·
   *ydemptice* identically · *invisibiliter* invisibly · *sensibiliter* perceptibly · *corporaliter* bodily ·
   *substancialiter* substantially · *dimensionaliter* dimensionally. A term still missing a row (*ydemptificacio*,
   *conversio*, *fractio*, *confessio auricularis*, *absolucio*, *claves* …): render it sensibly, untagged, and
   propose it. *Ego Berengarius* stays as the decree's title (Wyclif's spelling *Beringarius* in the Latin;
   "Berengar" for the man in the English). In ch. 1, *res sacramenti* "reality of the sacrament" is a ruled
   row: the compendium's *de rebus huius sacramenti* (1.3) is the three-membered distinction the chapter sets
   out, so keep its *res* consistent with that row.
2. **Connectives carry the argument.** ⛔ Never omit one, never turn one into filler.

   | Latin | English | Never |
   |---|---|---|
   | enim, nam | for | "now", "indeed" |
   | ergo, igitur, ideo | therefore, so, then | "now", "and", "indeed" |
   | sed / autem, marking the **minor premiss or next step** | now | (omitted) |
   | sed / autem, adversative | but | (omitted) |
   | autem, continuative | and | (omitted), and **not "now"** |
   | cum (concessive / causal) | although / since | "whenever" |
   | tamen | yet, nevertheless | "therefore" |
   | item | again, also | "now" |
   | vero (continuative) | and; but (adversative) | "now", "truly" |
   | verumtamen | nevertheless | "but truly" |
   | unde | hence, so | "whence" (archaic), "where" |
   | per idem | by the same token | "in the same way" |
   | ymmo | indeed, rather (correcting upward) | (omitted) |
   | patet; constat | it is clear; it is evident | |

   "Now" is reserved for the minor premiss, or the step that brings a new premiss to bear. An *autem*
   that only extends the same step is "and". ⚠ The commonest error in *De ecclesia* (close-out, ~50 of
   69 connective fixes): a *sed* that brings the minor premiss of a syllogism closed by *ergo / ideo /
   igitur* rendered "but". Before writing "but" for a *sed*, look ahead for the *ergo*: if one follows,
   it is "now".
3. **Ordinary words with a medieval sense:** GLOSSARY §D; look up any word whose classical and
   Wyclifite senses may differ, and propose additions.
4. **Syntax:** construe before rendering (main verb, subject, what every relative and genitive hangs
   on). Keep quantifier order where it is meaning. Keep Wyclif's long periods where English tolerates
   them. **A doubtful construal is never chosen silently:** translate the likelier reading and write a
   **C** note giving the alternative.
   ⚠ **Predication is the matter here, as in *De incarnacione*.** *Hoc est corpus meum*, *panis est
   corpus Christi*, *hoc sacramentum est panis*: Wyclif argues about what the pronoun demonstrates and
   in what mode the predicate holds. Keep subject and predicate in his order, keep *est* as "is" (never
   "exists", "becomes" or "represents" unless the Latin says so), and keep the mode adverb where he puts
   it (*est sacramentaliter corpus Christi* "is sacramentally the body of Christ"). ⛔ Never soften "is"
   into "signifies" or harden "figuratively" into "really": the difference is the treatise's matter.
   Demonstrative pronouns (*hoc*, *istud*) under discussion: render "this", and keep their gender
   visible in a C note where the argument turns on it (*hoc* neuter against *hic*, 348).
   **Propositions in indirect speech** whose sense is under discussion: render as the quoted proposition
   ("who say 'this is an accident without a subject'"), not "who say that …", which asserts it.

## Scripture

`python3 scripts/w3/bible.py "I Cor 10:16"` (Vulgate + Douay–Rheims; psalms in Vulgate numbering) or
`python3 scripts/w3/bible.py --find "panis quem frangimus"`. Where Wyclif's Latin agrees with the
Clementine Vulgate, use the **Douay–Rheims wording**. Where he departs, translate *his* Latin and write
an **S** note giving the Vulgate. Modern references in the English (1 Cor. 10:16). The chapter numbers
are Wyclif's, the verse numbers Loserth's (the headnote says so once).

## Notes

- `[^n]` from 1, the marker placed in the same edit as its note, each opening with a type letter **with a
  full stop** (`**C.**`; the site strips only that form): **T** text · **C** construal · **G** glossary
  (passage-specific only; otherwise a tag) · **S** source · **R** reception/context (a manuscript's
  marginal note Loserth prints; Hus's or the Hussites' reuse where Loserth notes it). A note that does two
  jobs takes the combined code (`**S/T.**`, `**C/S.**`; lint accepts it). The first occurrence of a CONTEXTUAL
  row in each chunk (*sentencia*, *inconveniens*) always gets its **C** note.
- **Density: about one note per 70–100 Latin words**, fewer where the text is plain. Short, factual,
  says what the Latin does and stops. No modern theology, no evaluation, ⛔ no judgement on whose
  eucharistic doctrine is right.
- **Every identification** other than scripture checked with bible.py gets a ledger row in your report
  with a status: `editor` (Loserth's source reference at the page foot), `to-verify` (from memory: every
  patristic, scholastic or canon-law identification you did not read in this session), `verified` (you
  read the source text this session: say where; local PL at `~/patrologia/sources/pl/tei/`). ⛔ Never
  pass memory off as verified. Id `K<chunk>-<n>` (`K01a-1`; ⚠ `K`, since `E` is *De ecclesia*, `P`
  *De potestate pape*, `I` *De incarnacione*), cited in the note: "(LEDGER K01a-1)". Loserth's references
  to the *Corpus iuris canonici* are `editor`; give them in modern form (*De cons.* D. 2 c. 42) and say
  the form is ours. Expect above all: Gratian *De consecratione* D. 2 (*Ego Berengarius*, c. 42;
  Augustine and Ambrose there), Augustine (*In Ioh.*, *De civ. Dei*, sermons), Ambrose *De sacramentis*
  and *De mysteriis*, Hilary, Jerome, Bernard, Thomas (*ST* III qq. 73–83; *In IV Sent.*), Scotus,
  the Lombard *Sent.* IV d. 8–13, Grosseteste.

## Model of register

`pilots/wyc-ecclesia-01a.md` (De ecclesia pp. 1–5) is a reviewed model of register and note style: read
it for that only (it predates some GLOSSARY rulings; **GLOSSARY governs**). **The first chunk, `prol-a`** (the compendium), carries
the `## Headnote` for the whole volume; `pen01` carries a short headnote for *De penitencia* and `quest` one for the
*Questio* (date, sigla, Loserth's remarks on the text). The headnote ⛔ is **not** the card's thesis paragraph: "The move" is how the compendium *builds* the case, chapter by chapter, and names no adversary the chunk does not name; the date is given as Loserth's evidence plus the modern dating, each `[verify]`. The headnote (CONVENTIONS §12 order: occasion, text, the work's move, where it is answered; date,
editor, the two works and their sigla, the compendium, the *Questio*), each unverified claim marked
`[verify]`.

## Transcription notes

The variant list is either complete against the page-foot apparatus or headed "selected"; none that affects the
English may be left out. Plate readings and fixes to the Latin (stray stops that were ink flecks) are recorded
there.

## Side-notes

Already read against the plates (WORKFLOW 5, `text/eucharistia/sidenotes.fixed.tsv`) and placed in your
scaffold's section. ⛔ Do not edit them. One that is plainly wrong (garbled, or at the wrong line):
report it under Latin doubts as `side-note page.line`.

## Finish

1. `status: translated` in the front matter (nothing else changes there).
2. `.venv/bin/python scripts/w3/lint.py chunks/eucharistia/<your chunk>.md` until clean.
3. The four-class check above, sentence by sentence.
4. ⛔ Edit **only your chunk(s)**. No git, no other files. Everything shared goes in your report.

## Report (≤ 200 words per chunk, exactly these heads)

- **Chunk:** id, Latin words, notes.
- **Ledger rows:** in LEDGER.md's table format `| id | chunk / note | claim | status | how / next step |`.
- **Glossary proposals:** Latin · proposed English · where · why.
- **Latin doubts:** page.line · printed · suspicion · settled on the plate?

## Glossary (the 529 rows these chunks use; the full file is GLOSSARY.md)

# GLOSSARY — FROZEN 2026-09-28 (Wilson's pilot review)

*One Latin term, one English rendering, every time, across the whole corpus. A reader must be able
to recognise the same word coming back, because Wyclif's arguments turn on it. A rendering changes
only by a dated decision in CONVENTIONS' decision log, never silently in a chunk. Entries may be
*added* by recorded decision as new terms appear. **Tag keys:** a chunk tags a term as
`[English]{g:latin-form}` (CONVENTIONS §11), and the key must match a Latin form in one of the rows
below. These rows are also the source of the site's hover glossary. Where a term has two senses,
the entry says so and each chunk's note picks one. A term marked **CONTEXTUAL** holds together
senses English splits: its English is chosen by context, under the dikaiosune rule (CONVENTIONS §6).*

**Sources of the decisions.** "Pilot" = settled in `pilots/` this session. "T. p. N" = Mark
Thakkar, "Duces caecorum," *Vivarium* 58 (2020), page N (`reference/`), which documents the
errors of the two most recent translations. His corrections are adopted here unless an entry says
otherwise.

**Orthography.** Headwords are given in the Society editions' medieval spelling (*eciam*,
*racio*, *quiditas*, *ymmo*), because that is what the translator will meet on the page.

## A. The church

| Latin | English | Note |
|---|---|---|
| ecclesia | church | Lower-case in English except in a proper title. |
| ecclesia militans / triumphans / dormiens | the church militant / triumphant / sleeping | *Dormiens* = the souls in purgatory. Not "dormant". |
| pars peregrinans; peregrinari | the pilgrim part; to be a pilgrim | Augustine's *peregrinatio* (Ench. 56). Pilot. |
| predestinatus, -i | the predestinate (sg. "a predestinate [person]") | Never "the elect", which is *electi* and gets "the elect". |
| prescitus, -i | **the foreknown** | ⭐ Wyclif's technical term for those God foreknows will be damned. It is **not** "the reprobate" (*reprobi* → "the reprobate"). Explain it in a note at its first occurrence in **each work**. The English word misleads on its own and Penn explains it only once (T. p. 361 n. 12). Pilot. |
| via / patria | the way / the homeland | *Beatitudo patrie* → "the blessedness of the homeland". Pilot. The earthly sense (one's native country) is also "homeland"; a note where it matters (*Dial.* 54.2). |
| corpus Christi misticum | the mystical body of Christ | |
| mater nostra | our mother | Church as mother is the governing figure of *De ecclesia* I. |
| fides formata / informis | formed faith / unformed faith | Faith formed by charity. Pilot. |
| fides explicita / implicita | explicit faith / implicit faith | The scholastic pair (*Dial.* 28.16–17). Ruled 2026-09-28. |
| articulus fidei | article of faith | Ruled 2026-09-28 (4 sites). |
| infidelis | unbeliever; with a dative, faithless (to) | Two senses by construction. Pairs with *infidelitas*, unbelief. Ruled 2026-09-28 (10 sites). |
| Christicole | worshippers of Christ | Ruled 2026-09-28. |
| suffragia | suffrages | The prayers and good works shared out by the church or an order. Ruled 2026-09-28 (11 sites). |
| suffragari | to aid by intercession | The verb of *suffragia*. Ruled 2026-09-28 (2 sites). Where privileges or law, not prayers, do the aiding: "to aid" (*Eccl.* 241.1; cf. *suffragium* "aid"), 2026-10-02. |
| litere fraternitatum | letters of fraternity | Friars' letters admitting a benefactor to the order's suffrages. Ruled 2026-09-28 (4 sites). |
| capitaneus | captain | Kept apart from *caput* "head": Wyclif grants the pope captaincy and denies him headship. Ruled 2026-10-01 (*Eccl.* 17.13, 19.21–24, 22.8). |
| ecclesiastici | CONTEXTUAL: clergy / those who belong to the church | Usually the clergy; where Wyclif means every member of the church (*Eccl.* 81.4) render "those who belong to the church" and write a **C** note. Ruled 2026-10-02. |
| prepositura | office of superior | The abstract beside *prepositi*. Ruled 2026-10-02 (95.3). |

# *De eucharistia*, chapter 6, part 6: [TITLE]

## ¶1 · 178.31–179.3

> [p. 178] Secundo per se dantur gracie ad cavendum a malo et innitendum bono; et tercio datur bonum perseverancie [p. 179] ad malum ingratitudinis fugiendum et bonum virtutis finaliter amplectendum; et indigna accepcio facit omnino oppositum.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶2 · 179.4–179.31

> [p. 179] Videtur autem quod pregravatus eciam mortali potest in casu dolere de crimine et, assistente sancto ac devoto proposito faciendi in memoriam Christi hanc celebritatem sacramenti, ut animus contritus devocius et attencius serviat Deo suo. Potest enim hoc sacramentum occasionaliter delere tam veniale peccatum quam mortale et sic penas tollere ac gracias et virtutes inducere, non quod ipsum habeat graciam in se formaliter vel efficienciam intrinsecam virtutum, sed est occasio et obiectum anime ut memorando gesta Christi per eius efficaciorem influenciam acquirat copiosius actus et habitus virtuales, sic quod oportet quod omnis virtus huius sacramenti primo procedat a Deo, secundo ab homine et tercio occasione obiectiva a sacramento, sicut sanitas corporalis fit primo a Deo communiter influente, secundo a virtute regitiva anime et tercio obiective et quodammodo effective a corporali medicamine: sic est quodammodo in sacramenti suscepcione. Nam sicut non prodest corporalis medicina, si vis anime sanativa defuerit, sic est de sacramenti suscepcione. Unde sicut medicina non prodest lapidi, tumido fluxui vel membro sicco in calore et virtute assimilativa claudicanti, sic in parte ymaginandum est de medicina sacramentali quoad infidelem ut lapis; quoad lubricum et superbum ut corpus plectoratum et repletum; et quoad mundialem avaricia in devocione siccatum et calore ignis celestis per frigus terrenorum mortificans destitutum.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶3 · 179.32–180.8

> [p. 179] Et utinam nimis false colentes hoc sacramentum ut signum, reliquias sanctorum et peregrinaciones pro [p. 180] indulgenciis clare attenderent istam sentenciam; tunc enim summe ponderarent insensibile signatum et quodcunque signum sensibile colendo respicerent proporcionaliter ut elevat animum ad Deum et invisibilia devocius attendendum. Conclusiones autem fideles sequentes ex isto principio fidei publicet cordatus theologus qui pro veritate fidei et correccione erroris ecclesie vult pati obprobria et occidi.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶4 · 180.9–180.27

> [p. 180] Ad quantum autem Deus iuvat efficaciter cultorem propter signa talia inanimata, non est nostrum discutere, sed credo quod proporcionaliter ut placet Deo dignitatem hominis vel eius meritum et sic donum proprium coronare. Et istam sentenciam pertractarent doctores antequam tantum difficultarent ecclesiam, quomodo hoc sacramentum in comparacione ad reliqua tollit peccata et dat graciam tam vivis quam mortuis; hec enim facit ut ipse persone sunt digne divino suffragio vel ut sic discamus quod non sit aliud nomen sub divinitate preter Christum in quo oportet nos salvos fieri, et quod ipse pater apud quem non est personarum accepcio omnem gentem que confidit in ipso et addit opera meritoria vult salvare. Fragilitas itaque indisponit hominem sed non per se sed inordinata affeccio, sicut nihil per se disponit hominem ad beatitudinem nisi Deus efficaciter et virtus formaliter; sed alia per accidens iuvant de quanto promovencia sunt ad ista.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶5 · 180.28–181.3

> [p. 180] Sed tercio obicitur per hoc quod iuxta dicta omnes pertinaciter dogmatisantes inpossibile in hoc sacramento sunt expresse heretici, omnes heretici sunt [p. 181] fugiendi et finaliter occidendi: ergo tota ista secta in scola eukaristie est taliter castiganda, quod si fieret, foret nimis magna perturbacio in ecclesia.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶6 · 181.4–182.8

> [p. 181] Hic videtur sentenciam istam moderatam esse katholicam et notandam; nam fides Christi docet katholicum plus attendere ad nutritiva ac edificatoria ad salutem anime quam corporis. Aliter enim foret infideli deterior, sed coquus parans venenum domino vel aliter prodens ipsum aut regnum debet post noticiam tractari ut proditor: ergo multo magis proditores anime severius sunt tractandi. Prelati enim et clerici sunt nedum coqui regi et regno sed mediatores inter Deum et ipsos, oblaciones populi fideliter offerentes; in quo si defuerint, ubi maior prodicio? Dicitur autem nostros mundo divites se ipsos et plebem prodere, cum ordinant tales curatos inter Deum et populum mediare qui maxime elongantur a Christi conversacione, maxime cecantur in evangelica veritate et maxime dissimilantur apostolis in conversacione. Quomodo, inquam, non tales et omnes eis consentanei pararent subditis cibum toxicum, procurarent proditorie vindictam apud Deum et tardarent volentes stricto itinere sequi Christum? Nam predicare nesciunt, consecrare nolunt et orare fastidiunt. Quod si tales quidquam istorum faciunt ad detrimentum sui et populi, sese fallunt; quid, inquam, valet predicacio prelati qui in facto Dei oderit disciplinam? Quid valet eius celebracio, qui in conversacione est tante Christo contrarius, ut puta in superflua familia ecclesie pauperum maxime onerosus, in delicata mensa non pauperum sed discolorum maxime sumptuosus et in occupacione mundana constanter sollicitus? Talis, inquam, memoratur Christum sicut [p. 182] Scarioth, qui habuit ipsum in vigilanti memoria ad prodendum. Et in isto laborant divites et pauperes, sicut fratres qui vel tacent vel excitant dominos ad bellandum, obliti ad pacem consulere et salubres veritates katholicas promovere. Et presagium huius divisionis in moribus est multiplicitas opinionum in materia de sacramento altaris, scilicet inter episcopos et plebeos.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶7 · 182.9–182.27

> [p. 182] Unde episcopi nostri et sue ecclesie in ista materia multipliciter variantur cuius variacionis causa est vacillacio magistrorum; secundum enim quod pedagogus prelatum docuerit ita credet; et est verisimile quod episcopi apponent diligenciam ad istum articulum cognoscendum. Aliter enim adorarent quod nesciunt, et ipsimet cece caderent in profundum fovee ydolatrie et ecclesiam suam traherent post ipsos precipitem, cum regulariter consequitur grex pastorem; et iterum non tot forent scripta de isto ut fidei articulo, nisi ecclesia et specialiter episcopi obligati ad instruendum ecclesiam suam in fide supereminenter debeant istud scire. Turpe quidem foret quod nostri episcopi scandalizarentur in isto quod bene cognoscunt ymagines auri et argenti sed ignorant generaliter quidditatem sacramenti altaris, cum pro libro sic palpant figuras pecunie et per hoc sacramentum quod infinitum dotacionem temporalem sui episcopatus exsuperat emunt a sapiencia odiente ignoranciam regnum celi.

[ENGLISH]

## Loserth's side-notes (PD, verbatim; not our translation)

- 179.4: It may be the occasion of destroying even mortal sin, although it has no such power in itself.
- 179.32: Sign-worshippers; astray also as to relics and pilgrimages.
- 180.9: How far God makes outward signs profitable to the worshipper depends on His good pleasure.
- 180.28: We are accused of wishing to persecute and slay all our opponents.
- 181.4: It is true that false clergy are traitors of the worst kind.
- 182.9: Surely our bishops must strive to know the true nature of the sacrament.
- 182.21: They know perfectly the forms of money although that is of little importance.

# *De eucharistia*, chapter 6, part 7: [TITLE]

## ¶1 · 182.28–183.3

> [p. 182] Unde nota nimis magne infidelitatis foret in illis quod figuram pecunie et eius quidditatem cognoscerent sed formam et quidditatem huius hostie penitus [p. 183] ignorarent. Quid enim plus scandalizaret prelatum, quam quod diligenter curet de karactere sigilli vel carte et non curet de quidditate hostie consecrate.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶2 · 183.4–184.15

> [p. 183] Ex istis colligitur primo quod illi qui ex ista ignorancia infideli sine causa accusant prelatos ecclesie sunt culpandi. Secundo quod illi prelati religionum qui in suis capitulis accusant precipue fratres suos, quia predicant in patria quod sacramentum altaris nec est corpus Christi nec sanguis, sed efficax eius signum; tales enim prelati tanquam infideles heretici inhabilitant se ad quascunque dotaciones regis et alia suffragia regni nostri. Et tercio creditur quod episcopi acute prosecuntur errores dogmatisantes in ista materia, cum instanter persecuti sunt evangelisantes quod domini temporales debent exonerare eos a temporalibus auferendis in casu quo eorum ponderacio ceca undique sit nociva. Ille enim qui preponderat signum fallax et fetidum prosperitatis mundane signo vero et venerabili corporis domini Jesu Christi nedum est indignus possidere predia sed ut sit incola terre nostre: ideo timendo istam persecucionem severam protestatus sum publice quod volo humiliter corrigi per quoscunque et specialiter per episcopos qui docuerint in ista materia veritatem. Sed volo querere signum, unde doctrine quam asserunt fideliter possum confidere. Possunt autem omnes usus ecclesiarum regis nostri ad istam triplicitatem reduci: primo dicitur secundum illos episcopos qui innituntur legi cesaree quod sacramentum altaris est ponderositas: utinam non libret suos usurarios ad infernum. Fundatur autem istud super dicto glosse ordinarie cuiusdam [p. 184] cesarei in De Consecracione, distinccione IIᵃ, capitulo Sacramentum, ubi movet dubium si hoc sacramentum potest cadere, cum sit accidens et non pondus: Dicit, inquit, quod potest cadere et dicit quod ponderositas remanet cum accidentibus aliis et dicit quod illa non est aliquid ponderosum, cum sacramentum quod per se movetur non sit ponderosum, relinquitur quod sit ponderositas in abstracto. Et sic maior pars Anglicane ecclesie ad ponderositatem hostie declinabit, cum quasi per totam Cantuariensem provinciam servabitur iste usus. Sed constat quod auctor huius sentencie ignorat vocem propriam, cum hoc sacramentum potest ad omnem eius punctum ponderositatem deperdere; oportet ergo dare aliquid ponderosum' quod fiat continue remissius ponderosum.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶3 · 184.16–185.11

> [p. 184] Secundus usus sparsus in multis ecclesiis est quod hostia altaris sit quantitas; sed iste usus est non minus a katholicis abrogandus, cum stat sacramentum istud per totum rarefieri vel condensari et per consequens ipsum sacramentum sic moveretur, quod non potest competere quantitati, quia sic remaneret antiqua quantitas acquirens ad omnem punctum quantitatem novam, et per consequens immediate postquam maiorari inceperit, fieret infinitum, quia infinitas quantitates secundum se totas acquireret, quarum quelibet foret maior quam sacramentum in principio assignatum; ideo difficultatur iste usus quomodo [p. 185] hoc sacramentum potest tales quantitates acquirere tanquam partes, cum nec sint partes eius quantitative nec qualitative; nec quantitas talis potest esse accidens quantitati nec sacramentum istud sic subito deperdi; unde quamvis diocesis Linconiensis cui dicitur iste usus competere sit ampla et rara, tamen oportet ipsam inniti magis stabili fundamento, nam superficies vel linea non potest sic qualificari in hostia, sed sanctitas sacramentalis videtur esse in qualitate que est de genere activorum; constancior enim videtur esse duricies quantitate.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶4 · 185.12–185.17

> [p. 185] Ideo tercius usus est credere quod sacramentum altaris sit qualitas. Unde illi qui vident acucius eligunt quod hoc sacramentum de omnibus qualitatibus sit albedo; ipsa enim plus inter alios colores suscitat visionem; et hic usus in Vallia montuosa et Hibernia ubi vident mortuos est famosus.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶5 · 185.18–186.19

> [p. 185] Sed patet error in isto usu ex hoc quod nec variatur hoc sacramentum in specie ut color hostie, nec qualitas talis potest exspectare intencionem et remissionem in colore ut hostia, quia nec potest sic alterari nec componi ex suis partibus intensivis, sic quod una medietas intensiva sit sacramentum et alia non sacramentum. Sic enim posset rarefieri et condensari, et per consequens tanquam prius natura posset sibi subicere quantitatem. Potest enim successive fieri maius aut minus et per consequens acquirere vel deperdere magnitudinem. Et tunc nimis errarunt philosophi ponentes quantitatem secundum genus precedere qualitatem. Si ergo hoc sacramentum sit sic quantum, tunc est coloratum et per consequens non est color, sed distinguuntur ut accidens et subiectum. Si, inquam, [p. 186] hoc sacramentum sit quantum accidentatum et quale intensum, tunc quantitas sibi accidentalis quam acquirit est alterius racionis et est dignius quantitate. Et istud videtur decretalis sentire libro III, capitulo Cum Marthe, que ponit colorem vini sine subiecto posse profundere se per aquam maiorem, quod non potest competere quantitati; quantitas ergo que potest per se occupare locum maiorem quam nunc occupat et sic acquirere ac perdere quantitatem potest rarefieri et condensari. Et iuxta hoc quot sunt ecclesie tot possunt esse errores mendaces de quidditate hostie, ut unus dicit quod est odor, alius quod est duricies, tercius quod est sapor et sic in infinitum secundum quod afficiunt qualitati quam faciunt. Et omnes isti senciunt minus erronee quam illi qui ponunt quod sacramentum est quantitas vel fasciculus omnis generis accidentis. Omnes tamen isti in hoc conveniunt quod hoc sacramentum est infinitum abieccioris nature quam aliqua vilis substancia corporea assignanda.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶6 · 186.20–186.28

> [p. 186] Et quantum ad mores attinet, modicum honoramus hoc sacramentum, cum honor ille stat in imitacione Christi in moribus, in vita pauperi et penali et in mundi abieccione pro ritu iusticie; quod licet sit infinitum melius hostia parum attendimus sed mendaciter fingimus indumentum abiectissimum corpori Christi competere et accumulamus mendacium, dicentes Christum signum istius nature ad cultum suum statuere.

[ENGLISH]

## Loserth's side-notes (PD, verbatim; not our translation)

- 183.4: They are to blame who accuse prelates wrongly. Those prelates are false heretics who prosecute their brethren for preaching the symbolic nature of the sacrament.
- 183.11: They shew themselves only too ready to prosecute.
- 183.21: Wyclif is ready to be corrected but desires some reason for trusting in the bishops' teaching.
- 183.26: Three beliefs common in the Church: 1. That the host is weight.
- 184.16: 2. The Sacrament is quantity.
- 185.4: This view prevails in Lincoln diocese.
- 185.12: 3. The Sacrament is quality, say whiteness. White is the most visible colour, so this notion is naturally prevalent in the welsh mountains and in Ireland where men see the dead.
- 186.10: Other views as the host: that it is odour, hardness etc.

# *De eucharistia*, chapter 6, part 8: [TITLE]

## ¶1 · 187.1–188.23

> [p. 187] Revera glossantes decreta et decretales opinantur honorabilius quod panis et vinum sunt hoc sacramentum, quod non dampnant nec reprobant sed confirmant. Et sic fecerunt sancti doctores concorditer. Unde Rabanus libro De Naturis rerum, libro Vᵒ, capitulo XI declarat quare Deus voluit se ipsum coli sacramentaliter in pane et vino et in fine sic loquitur: Aliud est sacramentum, aliud virtus sacramenti; sacramentum enim ore percipitur, virtute sacramenti homo interior saciatur; igitur quia panis corpus confirmat, ideo ille corpus Christi congruenter nuncupatur; vinum autem quia sanguinem operatur in carne, ideo ad sanguinem Christi refertur; hec autem dum sunt visibilia sanctificata per Spiritum Sanctum, in sacramentum divini corporis transeunt. Ecce plane sentencia quam predixi. Unde ante sic loquitur: Maluit enim Dominus corporis et sanguinis sacramenta fidelium ore percipi et in partem eorum redigi, ut per visibile opus invisibilis ostenderetur effectus. Ecce quod iste magnus doctor dictat cum experiencia quod panis et vinum que sunt sacramentum corporis et sanguinis Domini rediguntur in partem hominis quoad corpus, ut figuretur pastus interioris hominis per rem huius sacramenti, ut sepe declarat in libro suo De corpore et sanguine Domini. Et idem allegatum est ex testimonio Augustini in De Consecracione, distinccione IIᵃ, Corpus, et Johannis Damasceni et aliorum, quamvis ista sentencia sit per novos recentesque qui venerunt nimis sophistice palliata. [p. 188] Antiqua itaque sanctorum est sentencia quod forma, species vel figura panis et vini sunt hoc sacramentum; et per hec tria nomina intelligunt essenciam vel quidditatem panis et vini. Sic enim loquitur Apostolus Hebr. I, 3, quando dicit Christum eternaliter fuisse in forma Dei, cum sit splendor patris et figura substancie eius. Non enim intelligunt sancti quod hoc sacramentum quod vocant figuram panis sit qualitas de IVᵗᵃ specie qualitatis, quia illa est debilissime entitatis. Nec dubium alicui loyco quin sequitur: Christus sumitur in forma panis et vini, ergo ille panis et vinum sunt, ut patet per argumentum Christi quo (ut dicitur Luc. XX) convicerat Saduceos. Et illi qui dicunt quod false vocatur forma panis et vini, quia est forma per se stans, que olim fuit accidens panis et vini, que iam non sunt secundum aliquam partem sui, nituntur sophisticare sensus populi, ne credat illud quod plane sentit sed cogatur credere false fictum incredibile, ut hoc sit via ad populum amplius seducendum. Unde solebam replicare contra hos glossatores quod ista est sentencia unius falsi et heretici ydiote, quia est sentencia eorum, qui olim fuerunt huiusmodi, quia ante baptisacionem suam; et utinam huiusmodi non sint modo.

## ¶2 · 188.24–189.28

> [p. 188] Ex istis probabiliter creditur quod episcopi tenentur sub pena amissionis omnium temporalium suorum (quia sub pena amissionis regni celorum) cognoscere quid sit hoc sacramentum, quia aliter sunt inepti fideliter informare populum; et omnes qui auctorisant et defendunt tales cifras integre incurrunt perdicionis periculum. Unde utinam gens Roberti quereret diligenter ab ipso cum suis cardinalibus quid de quidditate hostie sit credendum. Hoc enim secundum beatum Petrum est precipuum prelatorum officium parate et [p. 189] fideliter reddere racionem fidei et illam mundo postposito defendere et docere. Videtur, inquam, quod omne sensibile accidens in sacra hostia iuxta descripcionem sacramenti sit sacramentum vel saltem accidens adiuvans sacramenti; sed fides tractantis sacramentum et sanctificacio Dei spiritualiter iuvant et faciunt sacramentum. Cum autem omne per accidens sit reducibile ad aliquod per se, patet quod est dare substancialem essenciam vel naturam accidentibus illis substratam; sed ad racionem illam debemus parum attendere sed in racionem sui signati totam cogitacionem nostram suspendere. Et hec est racio quare sancti dicunt panem converti in corpus Christi vel sacramentum, ymmo panem esse corpus Christi, sicut dicimus peccatorem converti a membro dyaboli in filium Dei; que conversio est magis mirabilis quam conversio sacramenti. Sed nullibi in istis miraculis oportet quod Deus destruat substancialem essenciam, sed mutat ipsam in melius servando naturam. Et hoc servaremus nos qui signa tantum attendimus; Christus enim ordinavit nos comedere et bibere hostiam in hiis rebus, ut figurarent pastum anime tanquam finem. Et utinam tales cultores accidencium non sint a substancia corporis ecclesie exsufflandi; ponunt enim religioni Christi accidere totam regulam quam Christus tradidit et sic in accidentibus involvuntur; plus enim appreciantur terrena que adiacent quam virtutas.
