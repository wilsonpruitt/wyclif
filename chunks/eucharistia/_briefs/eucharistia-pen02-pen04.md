# Translation brief: eucharistia pen02–pen04

You translate these 3 chunk(s) of Wyclif's *Tractatus de eucharistia* in a single pass. Everything you need is in this file:
the working card, the glossary rows these chunks use, and for each chunk its scaffold and the editor's
apparatus for its pages. Work so as to use few tool calls:

1. Read this brief once (it is the only file you need to read, unless the card names one for your chunk).
2. For each chunk, write the COMPLETE chunk file ONCE with the Write tool to its path (given in the chunk's
   header below): the scaffold with `status: translated`, the title, the English after every Latin block,
   headings and side-notes as the card says, Notes, and Transcription notes, in the card's
   layout. Never alter the Latin. Do not make a series of small edits.
3. Use the apparatus given here for variants (the card's rule: a variant that gives the sense is translated
   with a T note citing the siglum; otherwise translate the print and flag it). Open a plate image only if a
   word cannot be construed at all from the print plus the apparatus; otherwise flag it as a Latin doubt.
4. Scripture: quote the Douay-Rheims as you know it. At the END, check every reference you quoted in ONE
   command: `cd /Users/wilsonpruitt/wyclif && .venv/bin/python scripts/w3/bible.py "Ref 1" "Ref 2" ...` and fix any wording
   that differs, in the same chunk file (this is the one allowed round of edits).
5. Run `cd /Users/wilsonpruitt/wyclif && .venv/bin/python scripts/w3/lint.py chunks/eucharistia/wyc-eucharistia-pen02.md chunks/eucharistia/wyc-eucharistia-pen03.md chunks/eucharistia/wyc-eucharistia-pen04.md` once and fix what it reports.
6. Final message: per chunk, the ledger rows (table: id | chunk / note | claim | status | how / next step),
   glossary proposals, Latin doubts, and a one-line note of anything the coordinator must decide.

Standing rules (from the *De ecclesia* briefs, 2026-10-02):
- Do NOT search the Patrologia or other sources; a separate checker verifies them afterwards. Give the
  editor's reference, the modern form in the English, and "to be checked" with a fresh LEDGER id per item
  (never reuse an id).
- Notes open with their bold class codes, `**S/C.**`, never bare letters mid-note. No process words in
  the notes ("the report", "the coordinator", "brief").
- OCR scars (stray English or margin letters, line numbers read as words, glued or broken words,
  numerals read as letters) stay out of the chunk: translate the print's word and list each scar in your
  final message only (page.line, token, likely print reading). The coordinator fixes the Latin.
- Flag every place the established Latin may have LOST a word (it does not construe, especially at a page
  head or foot) or DOUBLED one: page.line and the suspicion. Translate the print as it stands; supply a
  missing word only in brackets with a T note. The editor's print governs; list any departure.


## The working card

# TRANSLATOR CARD — one *De eucharistia* chunk

This card replaces reading CONVENTIONS, the pilot and Thakkar in full: it is their working core.
Adapted from `chunks/potestate-pape/CARD.md` (Loserth's other volume) with the B+ lessons of
`chunks/incarnacione/CARD.md` (2026-11-06; **reviewed 2026-11-06** on `prol-a`: `_review/REVIEW-prol-a.md`). Read it, then `GLOSSARY.md`,
then your scaffold (or your brief, which carries all three). Consult CONVENTIONS.md only when the card sends
you there. Work in `~/wyclif`. Wyclif is approached with **daggers drawn**: the most recent English
versions were "worse than useless" because of four error classes (below). Your English must survive
a hostile reader with the Latin open.

## Work lean (cost is per tool call: each call re-sends your whole context)

1. One call reading what you need (the brief, or CARD + GLOSSARY + scaffold).
2. **One** `bible.py` call with every scripture reference you need (it takes many refs).
3. Plates **only** for a Latin doubt the print plus apparatus cannot settle.
4. Write each finished chunk in **one** Write of the whole file (Latin blocks copied unchanged).
5. Lint once; fix; done. Draft in your head, not in the file.

## The volume

*Tractatus de eucharistia* and *Tractatus de penitencia sive de confessione*, ed. Johann Loserth (Wyclif
Society, 1892), from the plates of archive.org `latinworks13wycl` (**leaf = page + 71**; leaf images in
`text/eucharistia/raw/leaves/`). Three texts:

Chunk ids: `prol-a … prol-c` the compendium, `01-a … 09-n` the nine chapters, `pen01 … pen06` *De
penitencia*, `quest` the *Questio*.

- **pp. 1–10, the compendium** (*Sentencia tractatus de Eukaristia in compendio*, under "Prologus"): a
  medieval summary of the nine chapters that came down with the work. Translate it like the text.
- **pp. 11–326, the *Tractatus de eucharistia* (maior)**, nine long chapters. Written in Wyclif's last
  years, before 1382–83 (Loserth, Introd. §4: it shares passages word for word with *Sermones* III, and
  it avoids the words *substancia* and *materialis* of the bread, which Wyclif says in *Sermo* III.54 he
  has stopped using). Wyclif's case against the "modern" doctrine: that the consecrated host is in its
  nature bread and wine and sacramentally, figuratively, the body and blood of Christ; that an accident
  without a subject is impossible; that the decree *Ego Berengarius* (*De cons.* D. 2 c. 42) is the
  faith of the ancient Roman church; against the friars, Thomas, Scotus and "the sect of the signs".
  A **treatise**: Wyclif speaks in the first person, states conclusions, raises objections and answers
  them. The tractatus minor (the *Confessio*) is NOT in this volume (Shirley, *Fasc. Ziz.*).
- **pp. 327–348, *De eucharistia et penitencia sive de confessione*** in six chapters (only ch. 1 is on
  the eucharist; the rest is penance and auricular confession), then the short ***Questio ad fratres de
  sacramento altaris*** (pp. 347–348, its first part only: Loserth notes that the rest of the
  manuscript's text is not on the sacrament, and is Hus's).

**Sigla. ⚠ They differ between the two works.** *De eucharistia* (Introd. §5): **A** Vienna 3927;
**B** Vienna 3932; **C** Vienna 1387 ("the best of the three" Vienna MSS, correcting A and B); **D** Prague
Univ. IV D 22 (1404–05, Andreas of Kouřim); **E** Prague Univ. XI E 3 (1460; Loserth: "the best and most
reliable text of all the five"). Loserth's lettering "does not in any way refer to their respective
value". The Vienna MSS are one group, the Prague MSS another. *De penitencia* (Introd. §6): **A** Vienna
3927; **B** Bautzen, Gersdorf Library M. St. 80.7; **C** Vienna 1337; **D** Prague Univ. III G 11; **E**
Vienna 3980; **F** Vienna 4527. Cite variants with the sigla of the work you are in. Marginal notes in the
manuscripts that Loserth prints ("F in marg.", "DB in marg.") are reception: an **R** note where they
show how a reader took the text.

**The page foot** (in your brief as "apparatus", by page) has two blocks, both keyed to the **line**:
the variants (`19. C: ecclesie in marg. alia manu.`) and Loserth's source references. The OCR of it is
rough: read it for sense, not letter by letter, and read the plate foot where a variant matters.

## The job

The Latin in your scaffold is **established and frozen** (blind transcription of the plates, checked word
by word against a four-scan vote; residue read on the plate). Fill `[TITLE]` (short, lower case: "the
three opinions on the quiddity of the host"), each `[ENGLISH]`, the notes and the transcription notes;
set `status: translated`; lint; report.

- **Headings:** keep `## ¶k · range` exactly. **Never change a range; never split a paragraph.**
- **Never alter the Latin.** A transcription error you find (a stray mark, a broken word, a side-note
  word in the text) is REPORTED, never repaired in your file: the coordinator repairs the transcription
  (`text/eucharistia/bt/pNNN.txt`) and refreshes the chunk's Latin. A word that looks wrong: read the
  apparatus for that line first; then, if still doubtful, the plate (`text/eucharistia/raw/leaves/nLEAF.jpg`,
  LEAF = page + 71 padded to four digits: p. 1 = `n0072.jpg`). A variant that gives the sense → translate
  it + **T** note citing the siglum; a compelling emendation → translate it + **T** note "(our
  emendation)"; neither → translate the print and flag it. Never smooth nonsense into sense. Report every
  such case. **Loserth's printed text governs** (ruled 2026-10-02 for Loserth's volumes; the
  manuscripts-outrank-the-print rule is Harris's volumes only): translate it, his own emendations
  included, unless it will not construe; a manuscript reading is chosen only then, or where the source
  Wyclif quotes, read this session, agrees with it. Every departure gets a T note giving both readings.
- **The compendia (`prol-a … prol-c`) summarise chapters whose Latin is already established** in this
  directory. Where the compendium's ellipsis leaves a construal open (whose argument, which *per* phrase is a
  ground and which a means), grep the chapter's `>` blocks, follow them, and cite the page in the **C** note:
  that is construal, not source verification, and one call. (`prol-a` 2.1–5: the three decrees are the
  objections' grounds, ch. 1 pp. 24, 25, 28.)
- **English layout:** `[N]` at the same word as `[p. N]` in the Latin (the chunk's first `[p. N]` is
  implicit). Supplied words in `[brackets]`, sparingly, ⛔ never in italics. **Quotations** (a quotation running on across ¶s or into the next chunk opens each ¶ with a double quote and closes only at its end; quotations inside it take single quotes) in quotation
  marks. Your brief carries Loserth's **italic runs** per page where the scan's OCR gives them (rough;
  ⚠ page numbers drift: a run not in your page's Latin belongs to a neighbouring page): they are
  the editor's judgement of where a quotation runs, not the manuscript's: follow them by default, depart
  where the source shows otherwise (say so in a note). Reviews do not check quotation bounds against the
  italics. Italicised scripture inside indirect speech is quoted too; where quoting would garble the
  sentence, leave it unquoted and give the reference in an **S** note.
- **Ordinals:** a degree-sign ordinal can print or OCR like a two-digit number (*30 et 10* = 3° and 1°).
  Read both forms the same way, and check the plate when a citation looks impossible.
- **Formulae of the disputation** (ruled 2026-10-01; fixed renderings, tagged only where GLOSSARY has a
  row): *instatur* "it is objected" · *obicitur* "it is objected" · *arguitur* "it is argued" (with
  *per*: GLOSSARY) · *dicitur* "it is said" (in an answer: "the answer is") · *respondetur* "the reply is"
  · *conclusio* "conclusion" · *antecedens / consequens* "antecedent / consequent" · *consequencia*
  "inference", ⛔ never "consequence" · *patet* "it is clear" · *supponitur* "it is supposed" ·
  *probatur* "proof:" or "it is proved" · *confirmatur* "this is confirmed" · *solvit / dissolvit* (an objection) "resolves", both (never "answers", which belongs to *respondetur / dicitur*).
- **A source note says only what the Latin says about the source** (who narrates, which book, which work)
  and leaves the rest to the ledger: never supply a story the Latin rules out (*narratum a beato Gregorio*:
  Gregory narrates).
- **Citation formulae:** *ubi supra* "in the place cited above" (⛔ never a claim about where a passage
  stands), *ut supra* "as above", *infra* "below". *Utrobique* "on both sides / in both places".

## The four error classes (Thakkar) — check every sentence

1. **Terms:** GLOSSARY.md governs, one term one rendering. Tag the **first occurrence in the chunk** of
   every §A–C term: `[accident]{g:accidens}`; a multi-word key is lower case with hyphens, `{g:corpus-christi}`, `{g:a-simili}` (lint rejects spaces); never nest brackets inside a tag (`[form [sounds] with]{g:k}` breaks the site): tag the bare word. The key must exist in GLOSSARY.md. ⛔ A `(LEDGER …)` reference goes only in a note, never in the English running text. A term that looks
   technical but has no row: render it sensibly, untagged, and propose it in your report.
   **CONTEXTUAL** rows hold two senses English splits: choose by context and write a **C** note at the
   first occurrence in the chunk and wherever it leans to the other sense (the dikaiosune rule,
   CONVENTIONS §6).
   Rows that already exist and bear on this volume: *accidens* "accident" · *accidens absolutum*
   "absolute accident" · *transsubstanciacio* "transubstantiation" · *conficere* "consecrate (the
   eucharist)" · *figura / figuratum* "figure / thing figured" · *res sacramenti* "reality of the
   sacrament" · *sacramentalia* "sacramentals" · *quantus* "quantified" · *per se / per accidens* "of
   itself / by accident" · *sensibile commune* "common sensible" · *ecclesia* church (**lower-case**) ·
   *caritas* charity · *sentencia* teaching (and *sentencia verborum* "sense", a separate row) · *ex fide* as faith teaches ·
   *opinio* opinion · *novelli* the newer [doctors] · *sancti* the saints · *concludere* infer ("conclude" only where a
   conclusion is literally drawn) · *deduccio* deduction · *maneries* kind · *principaliter* as a main head ·
   *sensibilis* perceptible · *declarare / ostendere* make clear / show · *ecclesia* is tagged at its first
   occurrence in every chunk.
   **This volume's vocabulary is now ruled (2026-11-06, `prol-a` review):** *sacramentum* (the eucharist) ·
   *hostia* host · *panis / vinum* bread / wine · *calix* chalice · *corpus Christi / Domini* kept apart ·
   *remanencia* the remaining · *accidens sine subiecto* · *substancia · quantitas · qualitas* · *esse /
   esse sacramentale* being / sacramental being · *esus / manducacio* eating · *confeccio* consecration ·
   *secta signorum* · *novella / antiqua ecclesia* · *predicacio ydemptica / tropica* identical / tropical
   predication. **The mode adverbs, one word each, never merged, each tagged at first occurrence:**
   *sacramentaliter* sacramentally · *realiter* really (never "actually") · *vere* truly (never "really") ·
   *spiritualiter* spiritually · *virtualiter* virtually · *figurative* figuratively · *tropice* tropically ·
   *ydemptice* identically · *invisibiliter* invisibly · *sensibiliter* perceptibly · *corporaliter* bodily ·
   *substancialiter* substantially · *dimensionaliter* dimensionally. A term still missing a row (*ydemptificacio*,
   *conversio*, *fractio*, *confessio auricularis*, *absolucio*, *claves* …): render it sensibly, untagged, and
   propose it. *Ego Berengarius* stays as the decree's title (Wyclif's spelling *Beringarius* in the Latin;
   "Berengar" for the man in the English). In ch. 1, *res sacramenti* "reality of the sacrament" is a ruled
   row: the compendium's *de rebus huius sacramenti* (1.3) is the three-membered distinction the chapter sets
   out, so keep its *res* consistent with that row.
2. **Connectives carry the argument.** ⛔ Never omit one, never turn one into filler.

   | Latin | English | Never |
   |---|---|---|
   | enim, nam | for | "now", "indeed" |
   | ergo, igitur, ideo | therefore, so, then | "now", "and", "indeed" |
   | sed / autem, marking the **minor premiss or next step** | now | (omitted) |
   | sed / autem, adversative | but | (omitted) |
   | autem, continuative | and | (omitted), and **not "now"** |
   | cum (concessive / causal) | although / since | "whenever" |
   | tamen | yet, nevertheless | "therefore" |
   | item | again, also | "now" |
   | vero (continuative) | and; but (adversative) | "now", "truly" |
   | verumtamen | nevertheless | "but truly" |
   | unde | hence, so | "whence" (archaic), "where" |
   | per idem | by the same token | "in the same way" |
   | ymmo | indeed, rather (correcting upward) | (omitted) |
   | patet; constat | it is clear; it is evident | |

   "Now" is reserved for the minor premiss, or the step that brings a new premiss to bear. An *autem*
   that only extends the same step is "and". ⚠ The commonest error in *De ecclesia* (close-out, ~50 of
   69 connective fixes): a *sed* that brings the minor premiss of a syllogism closed by *ergo / ideo /
   igitur* rendered "but". Before writing "but" for a *sed*, look ahead for the *ergo*: if one follows,
   it is "now".
3. **Ordinary words with a medieval sense:** GLOSSARY §D; look up any word whose classical and
   Wyclifite senses may differ, and propose additions.
4. **Syntax:** construe before rendering (main verb, subject, what every relative and genitive hangs
   on). Keep quantifier order where it is meaning. Keep Wyclif's long periods where English tolerates
   them. **A doubtful construal is never chosen silently:** translate the likelier reading and write a
   **C** note giving the alternative.
   ⚠ **Predication is the matter here, as in *De incarnacione*.** *Hoc est corpus meum*, *panis est
   corpus Christi*, *hoc sacramentum est panis*: Wyclif argues about what the pronoun demonstrates and
   in what mode the predicate holds. Keep subject and predicate in his order, keep *est* as "is" (never
   "exists", "becomes" or "represents" unless the Latin says so), and keep the mode adverb where he puts
   it (*est sacramentaliter corpus Christi* "is sacramentally the body of Christ"). ⛔ Never soften "is"
   into "signifies" or harden "figuratively" into "really": the difference is the treatise's matter.
   Demonstrative pronouns (*hoc*, *istud*) under discussion: render "this", and keep their gender
   visible in a C note where the argument turns on it (*hoc* neuter against *hic*, 348).
   **Propositions in indirect speech** whose sense is under discussion: render as the quoted proposition
   ("who say 'this is an accident without a subject'"), not "who say that …", which asserts it.

## Scripture

`python3 scripts/w3/bible.py "I Cor 10:16"` (Vulgate + Douay–Rheims; psalms in Vulgate numbering) or
`python3 scripts/w3/bible.py --find "panis quem frangimus"`. Where Wyclif's Latin agrees with the
Clementine Vulgate, use the **Douay–Rheims wording**. Where he departs, translate *his* Latin and write
an **S** note giving the Vulgate. Modern references in the English (1 Cor. 10:16). The chapter numbers
are Wyclif's, the verse numbers Loserth's (the headnote says so once).

## Notes

- `[^n]` from 1, the marker placed in the same edit as its note, each opening with a type letter **with a
  full stop** (`**C.**`; the site strips only that form): **T** text · **C** construal · **G** glossary
  (passage-specific only; otherwise a tag) · **S** source · **R** reception/context (a manuscript's
  marginal note Loserth prints; Hus's or the Hussites' reuse where Loserth notes it). A note that does two
  jobs takes the combined code (`**S/T.**`, `**C/S.**`; lint accepts it). The first occurrence of a CONTEXTUAL
  row in each chunk (*sentencia*, *inconveniens*) always gets its **C** note.
- **Density: about one note per 70–100 Latin words**, fewer where the text is plain. Short, factual,
  says what the Latin does and stops. No modern theology, no evaluation, ⛔ no judgement on whose
  eucharistic doctrine is right.
- **Every identification** other than scripture checked with bible.py gets a ledger row in your report
  with a status: `editor` (Loserth's source reference at the page foot), `to-verify` (from memory: every
  patristic, scholastic or canon-law identification you did not read in this session), `verified` (you
  read the source text this session: say where; local PL at `~/patrologia/sources/pl/tei/`). ⛔ Never
  pass memory off as verified. Id `K<chunk>-<n>` (`K01a-1`; ⚠ `K`, since `E` is *De ecclesia*, `P`
  *De potestate pape*, `I` *De incarnacione*), cited in the note: "(LEDGER K01a-1)". Loserth's references
  to the *Corpus iuris canonici* are `editor`; give them in modern form (*De cons.* D. 2 c. 42) and say
  the form is ours. Expect above all: Gratian *De consecratione* D. 2 (*Ego Berengarius*, c. 42;
  Augustine and Ambrose there), Augustine (*In Ioh.*, *De civ. Dei*, sermons), Ambrose *De sacramentis*
  and *De mysteriis*, Hilary, Jerome, Bernard, Thomas (*ST* III qq. 73–83; *In IV Sent.*), Scotus,
  the Lombard *Sent.* IV d. 8–13, Grosseteste.

## Model of register

`pilots/wyc-ecclesia-01a.md` (De ecclesia pp. 1–5) is a reviewed model of register and note style: read
it for that only (it predates some GLOSSARY rulings; **GLOSSARY governs**). **The first chunk, `prol-a`** (the compendium), carries
the `## Headnote` for the whole volume; `pen01` carries a short headnote for *De penitencia* and `quest` one for the
*Questio* (date, sigla, Loserth's remarks on the text). The headnote ⛔ is **not** the card's thesis paragraph: "The move" is how the compendium *builds* the case, chapter by chapter, and names no adversary the chunk does not name; the date is given as Loserth's evidence plus the modern dating, each `[verify]`. The headnote (CONVENTIONS §12 order: occasion, text, the work's move, where it is answered; date,
editor, the two works and their sigla, the compendium, the *Questio*), each unverified claim marked
`[verify]`.

## Transcription notes

The variant list is either complete against the page-foot apparatus or headed "selected"; none that affects the
English may be left out. Plate readings and fixes to the Latin (stray stops that were ink flecks) are recorded
there.

## Side-notes

Already read against the plates (WORKFLOW 5, `text/eucharistia/sidenotes.fixed.tsv`) and placed in your
scaffold's section. ⛔ Do not edit them. One that is plainly wrong (garbled, or at the wrong line):
report it under Latin doubts as `side-note page.line`.

## Finish

1. `status: translated` in the front matter (nothing else changes there).
2. `.venv/bin/python scripts/w3/lint.py chunks/eucharistia/<your chunk>.md` until clean.
3. The four-class check above, sentence by sentence.
4. ⛔ Edit **only your chunk(s)**. No git, no other files. Everything shared goes in your report.

## Report (≤ 200 words per chunk, exactly these heads)

- **Chunk:** id, Latin words, notes.
- **Ledger rows:** in LEDGER.md's table format `| id | chunk / note | claim | status | how / next step |`.
- **Glossary proposals:** Latin · proposed English · where · why.
- **Latin doubts:** page.line · printed · suspicion · settled on the plate?

## Glossary (the 342 rows these chunks use; the full file is GLOSSARY.md)

# GLOSSARY — FROZEN 2026-09-28 (Wilson's pilot review)

*One Latin term, one English rendering, every time, across the whole corpus. A reader must be able
to recognise the same word coming back, because Wyclif's arguments turn on it. A rendering changes
only by a dated decision in CONVENTIONS' decision log, never silently in a chunk. Entries may be
*added* by recorded decision as new terms appear. **Tag keys:** a chunk tags a term as
`[English]{g:latin-form}` (CONVENTIONS §11), and the key must match a Latin form in one of the rows
below. These rows are also the source of the site's hover glossary. Where a term has two senses,
the entry says so and each chunk's note picks one. A term marked **CONTEXTUAL** holds together
senses English splits: its English is chosen by context, under the dikaiosune rule (CONVENTIONS §6).*

**Sources of the decisions.** "Pilot" = settled in `pilots/` this session. "T. p. N" = Mark
Thakkar, "Duces caecorum," *Vivarium* 58 (2020), page N (`reference/`), which documents the
errors of the two most recent translations. His corrections are adopted here unless an entry says
otherwise.

**Orthography.** Headwords are given in the Society editions' medieval spelling (*eciam*,
*racio*, *quiditas*, *ymmo*), because that is what the translator will meet on the page.

## A. The church

| Latin | English | Note |
|---|---|---|
| ecclesia | church | Lower-case in English except in a proper title. |
| ecclesia militans / triumphans / dormiens | the church militant / triumphant / sleeping | *Dormiens* = the souls in purgatory. Not "dormant". |
| predestinatus, -i | the predestinate (sg. "a predestinate [person]") | Never "the elect", which is *electi* and gets "the elect". |
| prescitus, -i | **the foreknown** | ⭐ Wyclif's technical term for those God foreknows will be damned. It is **not** "the reprobate" (*reprobi* → "the reprobate"). Explain it in a note at its first occurrence in **each work**. The English word misleads on its own and Penn explains it only once (T. p. 361 n. 12). Pilot. |
| viator | wayfarer | One still on the road, not yet in the homeland. Loserth: "a traveller on earth". Pilot. |
| via / patria | the way / the homeland | *Beatitudo patrie* → "the blessedness of the homeland". Pilot. The earthly sense (one's native country) is also "homeland"; a note where it matters (*Dial.* 54.2). |
| corpus Christi misticum | the mystical body of Christ | |
| mater nostra | our mother | Church as mother is the governing figure of *De ecclesia* I. |
| fides explicita / implicita | explicit faith / implicit faith | The scholastic pair (*Dial.* 28.16–17). Ruled 2026-09-28. |
| sacerdotes vulgares | common priests | The adjective; kept apart from *vulgares*, "the common people". Ruled 2026-09-28 (2 sites). |
| Christicole | worshippers of Christ | Ruled 2026-09-28. |
| litere fraternitatum | letters of fraternity | Friars' letters admitting a benefactor to the order's suffrages. Ruled 2026-09-28 (4 sites). |
| viantes | those on the road | The participle beside *viator* (wayfarer); kept distinct so the reader sees which word Wyclif used. Ruled 2026-10-01 (≈22 sites in *De ecclesia*; first *Eccl.* 10.12). |
| ecclesiastici | CONTEXTUAL: clergy / those who belong to the church | Usually the clergy; where Wyclif means every member of the church (*Eccl.* 81.4) render "those who belong to the church" and write a **C** note. Ruled 2026-10-02. |
| filii imitacionis | sons of imitation | Children of Abraham by imitating him, not by flesh. Ruled 2026-10-02 (89.27, 90.7). |
| ecclesia laycalis / secularis | the lay church / the secular church | Ruled 2026-10-02 (154.15, 156.3). |
| sacramentum (the Eucharist); sacramentum altaris | sacrament; the sacrament of the altar | The plain sense, against the Augustinian row (*Incarn.*). Ruled 2026-11-06 (coordinator, delegated; *Euch.* prol-a 1.3, 3.30). |

# *De eucharistia*, De eucharistia et penitencia, chapter 2: [TITLE]

## ¶1 · 331.23–331.28

> [p. 331] Sed quia locucio in ista materia est valde periculosa ex consuetudine antiquata et multi ac magni venerantur hoc sacramentum, ac si sine illo non poterit homini esse salus, ideo procedendo securius dicendum in principio quid sit de hoc sacramento invento ex tradicione hominum concedendum.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶2 · 332.1–332.27

> [p. 332] Et videtur in principio quod sit spirituale frenum contra peccata tam commissa delenda quam eciam ut homo caveat committenda. Multi enim in confitendo taliter habent dolorem et ruborem propter que volunt posterius precavere sic peccare alias, cum necessitati fuerint illud peccatum ostendere proprio sacerdoti; et sic videtur hoc sacramentum esse medicinam thyriacam contra peccatum commissum hominis abluendum et specialem preservativam ne homo iterum incidat in peccatum; et nisi hoc sacramentum haberet efficaciam, videtur quod Christus superflue dedisset apostolis et succedentibus sacerdotibus clavium potestatem. Ad quid rogo concessit Christus suis apostolis solvendi ligandique potestatem, nisi ostensio eorum sacerdoti solventi aut liganti faceret ipsa crimina esse nota? Quis, inquam, dubitat quod nemo abluit hominem a crimine quod ignorat? Et ad hoc sunt dicta Augustini et specialiter in De Visitacione infirmorum et scripta aliorum doctorum et dictorum papalium infinita. Quomodo eciam confiteretur quis peccata sua commissa suo proprio sacerdoti nisi auriculariter et sibi abscondite ipsis solis noscentibus, ut docet decretalis Omnis utriusque sexus? Aut quomodo foret peccatum deletum nisi per penitenciam iniunctam fiat satisfaccio pro eodem? Tales multas evidencias faciunt cupidi quidam ignari, qui nituntur libertatem legis Domini impugnare.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶3 · 332.28–333.9

> [p. 332] Ideo respondendo ad istos obiectus dicitur primo quod necesse est peccatori cuius peccata delenda sunt contricione animi penitere; sed ex hoc non infertur [p. 333] quod sit tam necessaria verbalis confessio sacerdoti. Concedo tamen quod necessaria est verbalis confessio sacerdoti conversanti cum peccatore sed non est simpliciter necessaria cuicunque, cum multis martyribus deest copia vel presencia sacerdotis; et multi tempore utriusque legis sine confessione tali in patria sunt salvati. Cum autem omnia que eveniunt de necessitate evenient et talis confessio prodest pluribus, patet quod talis confessio est necessario facienda.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶4 · 333.10–333.32

> [p. 333] Et iterum, cum auricularis et ista sacramentalis confessio ex institucione hominum prosit multis, patet quod illa confessio est necessario facienda proprio sacerdoti. Non autem dico quod est necessario facienda a quolibet viatore semel in anno, si salvabitur, cum Baptista et multi alii sancti salvantur, qui nunquam confessione huiusmodi erant usi. Nec subiacet potestati hominum huiusmodi sacramentum; Deus enim libertavit suam ecclesiam quod ex sua gracia et cordis contricione fidelium sine ista penitencia sint salvati, ut patet de Petro, Paulo et Magdalena cum multis ceteris. Nam isti tres sunt salvati ex fide scripture, et tamen quod ista sacra confessione mundati fuerant, non docetur. Et certum videtur quod Christus ecclesie sue foret negligens si hoc sacramentum foret sibi tam necessarium et tamen non foret usque ad solucionem sathane ecclesie declaratum. Nam blasphemum videtur asserere quod sancti usque ad edicionem istius decretalis in obmittendo istam penitenciam peccaverunt. Et iterum certum videtur quod si huius legis edicio fuit ita racionabilis tempore Innocencii IIIⁱⁱ, quod illa racio stetit prius et sic homines ex obmissione talis penitencie antea peccaverunt.

## Loserth's side-notes (PD, verbatim; not our translation)

- 331.23: Importance attached to penance.
- 332.1: It is said to be a check on sin and a help to wash away sin.
- 332.20: And how can a man confess except privately to his own priest.
- 332.28: Answer: Penance is necessary,
- 333.1: but verbal confession is not absolutely and in all cases needful.
- 333.10: And though it is binding because of the good it does, yet its use once a year is not necessary to salvation.
- 333.23: Christ ordained no such rule.

# *De eucharistia*, De eucharistia et penitencia, chapter 3: [TITLE]

## ¶1 · 334.2–335.11

> [p. 334] Videtur rimandum ulterius quis habet potestatem condere tales leges. Et videtur multis probabile quod solus dominus temporis qui est Deus, quia solus iste habet potestatem super longitudinem terre, super racionem legis et super genus hominum obligandum. Ideo papa non habet potestatem condendi hanc legem, sicut non Deus voluit ipsam condere, cum concessit libertatem homini penitencie huiusmodi repugnantem. Hortari autem posset papa vel alius ad taliter penitendum. Sed quod omnis homo qui discrecionem attigerit et proprium sacerdotem paratum habuerit, confiteatur semel in anno omnia peccata sua proprio sacerdoti sub pena dampnacionis, non subiacet potestati papali, cum nec potest dampnare hominem nec salvare, licet filii diaboli et filii Dei sunt occasio dampnacionis multorum et quare alii sunt salvati. Nec habet papa potestatem ordinandi quod perpetuo sint tales sacerdotes ydonei aut parati; nec habet potestatem obligandi racionem quod semel in anno sit sibi sufficiens, quin per idem semel in biennio vel quolibet alio tempore et de multis preservatis ex Dei gracia pro nullo tempore hoc oportet. Ideo dicunt aliqui quod verificatum in isto loco est dictum Apostoli II Thess. II quod Antichristus extollitur super omne quod dicitur Deus, eo quod Christus istam legem ordinare non potuit, si volebat. Sic ergo in quatuor religionibus privatis sepedictis licet quedam facere que regule istarum religionum precipiunt stante [p. 335] semper Domini libertate et non licet istis tradicionibus ut legi Domini taliter obligari: sic senciendum est de hac tradicione pape qui est patronus prime secte. Observet ergo fidelis christianus hanc libertatem taliter confitendi quod confiteatur taliter sacerdoti, si et quatinus prosit sibi et ecclesie. Et istam libertatem habet concessam a Domino quam papa non potest destruere neque dare. Et per hoc patet solucio ad dicta Augustini et sanctorum similium quod homo debet presbytero confiteri, quando Deus movet peccantem humiliter confiteri de peccatis propriis que commisit, tunc debet taliter confiteri.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶2 · 335.12–336.17

> [p. 335] Sed videtur multis quod generalis confessio et publica est melior quam confessio hec privata, utraque tamen est bona, licet in lege veteri et lege gracie prima sit magis fundabilis quam secunda; nec solum presbiteris est illa confessio facienda sed discretis tam viris quam feminis et omnimode Deo nostro. Et de illa generali confessione videtur loqui Jacobus, quando dicit: Confitemini alterutrum peccata vestra; et aliter usus ecclesie quod sacerdos confitetur peccata sua tam viris quam feminis ipsis existentibus quandoque solum in missarum suarum iniciis foret culpabiliter introductus. Et sic quidam sophisticant cum lege papali audientes missas proprii sacerdotis quandoque solitarii, dicentes quod fuerunt tunc confessi omnia peccata sua proprio sacerdoti. Sed videtur multis quod sophisticacio ista non sufficit cuicunque, cum multi necessitantur ostendere peccata sua discreto presbytero et recipere ab ipso salubre consilium quomodo [p. 336] de peccato preterito satisfaciant et pro peccato futuro de possibili precavebunt. Et tales fuerunt multi presbyteri tempore Augustini. Et sic concedo dictum Augustini quod homo debet, ymmo necessitatur confiteri peccata sua secundum formam quam Deus limitat. Sed absit ex isto concludere quod racionabile est omnem hominem confiteri semel in anno omnia peccata sua proprio sacerdoti, ut salubre est homini audire tempore congruo verbum Dei, sicut salubre est homini quoad corpus pasci cibario corporali. Sed insanum foret homini tempus statuere in quo sub pena mortis taliter sermonem audiat sive edat. Deus enim dedit homini liberum arbitrium et multis specialem instinctum, quando et qualiter debent taliter operari. Ideo nimia extollencia super Christum foret sic generaliter condere talem legem.

[ENGLISH]

## Loserth's side-notes (PD, verbatim; not our translation)

- 334.2: God only has the right to make such laws.
- 334.7: The Pope may not take away the freedom God has given.
- 334.16: He cannot damn nor save; nor can he provide fit priests everywhere.
- 335.3: Let the Christian use his freedom and confess if it profits him and the Church.
- 335.12: General and public confession is better than private, though both are good.
- 335.18: Confession need not be made only to priests.
- 335.25: How some evade the decree.
- 336.6: A man should judge when he will confess, as he judges when he will hear a sermon or take tood. So doing he uses rightly the free will God gives him.

# *De eucharistia*, De eucharistia et penitencia, chapter 4: [TITLE]

## ¶1 · 336.18–338.18

> [p. 336] Superest solvere alios obiectus qui videntur sonare quod ista sacramentalis penitencia est necessario facienda. Concesso ergo quod hoc sacramentum tam proficit quam officit diversis hominibus, videndum est primo de clavibus quas Christus concesserat Petro et ceteris apostolis cum suis successoribus; et dictum est diffuse alibi quod iste claves non sunt potestates spirituales date specialiter nostris sacerdotibus ad tollendum peccata hominibus, quia hoc est agno proprium sed iste claves sunt potestates et sciencie ad deviantibus indicandum conformiter voluntati divine secundum iudicium legis Dei. Et non dubium quin si sacerdos a clavibus triumphantis ecclesie hic erraverit quod neque solvit neque ligat spiritualiter. Et de quanto illis clavibus se conformaverit solvit vel [p. 337] ligat apud ecclesiam triumphantem. Sed quid hoc ad istam sacramentalem penitenciam introductam? Sic sepe peccata sua publica plus nota sunt sacerdoti qui ipsa percipit quam ipsi peccatori qui secundum legem istam de propriis criminibus confitetur? Unde Act. XIII, 10 Paulus ex revelacione plus cognovit peccata illius magi qui dicitur Barien vel Elimas quam ipsemet cognoverat hic in via. Et (ut breviter dicatur) papa vel sacerdos alius non habet scienciam peccati gravedinem cognoscendi qualitercunque peccans secundum ultimum sue noticie dixerit confessori nisi hoc specialiter sibi fuerit revelatum, quia quomodo sciret alter eorum quomodo peccatum illud ex concomitancia pene vel gracie finaliter qualificatum fuerit, cum hoc sit viatoribus ex revelacione specialiter cognoscendum, et per consequens nullus talis sacerdos cognoscit quanta aut quali penitencia foret dignus; ideo scripta et practisata de penitenciis patule contradicunt. Nec dubium quin Deus nollet quod sacerdos suus iniungeret penitenciam nisi eius quantitatem et qualitatem sibi ostenderit. Unde cum sacerdotes absolventes hoc sepe nesciunt, ymmo si hec penitencia confesso suo profuerit vel fuerit voluntati Dei contraria, videtur quod Deus non regulariter approbat talem penitenciam sic iniunctam. Christus enim iniunxit adultere nolle amplius peccare, ut patet Johannis VIII, Paulus eciam iniunxit isti mago Barien penitenciam quod ad tempus corporaliter foret cecus. Nec habet ista ars fundacionem vel evidenciam quod a Deo approbatur. Ideo videtur [p. 338] quod sit presumpta cecitas preter legem attemptata. Et quantam ad dicta doctorum atque papalia, patet ex multis testimoniis Augustini quod non valent nisi ex racione vel lege Domini sint fundata. Ideo non omnia scripta doctorum de istis penitenciis et absolucionibus ut evangelium sunt credenda. Hoc tamen debet fidelis credere quod quantumcunque Deo deliquerit, dum tamen Deo humiliter confessus fuerit remissionem et delecionem peccati habere poterit. Et hoc discretus sacerdos ex sua prudencia poterit promovere. Et sic generalis confessio sepe induceret ut in lege veteri maiorem penitenciam et ruborem, quam ista confessio specialis. Nec ex dicto pape vel experiencia est notum fidelibus quod hec introducta penitencia magis bonum facit ecclesie quam humano generi infert malum: Et nullus nostrorum confessorum scit debitam satisfaccionem, cum soli Deo sit cognitum limitare.

- 336.18: The keys that Christ gives are power and knowledge to direct men in the right way.
- 337.2: A priest may know a man's open sins better than the man himself does.
- 337.9: Without special revelation no Pope or priest can tell how gravely a penitent has sinned.
- 337.22: Hence he cannot assign penance rightly
- 338.5: We should believe that if we humbly confess to God our sins will be forgiven.
