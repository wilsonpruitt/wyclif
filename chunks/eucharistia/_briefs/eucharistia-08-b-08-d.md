# Translation brief: eucharistia 08-b–08-d

You translate these 3 chunk(s) of Wyclif's *Tractatus de eucharistia* in a single pass. Everything you need is in this file:
the working card, the glossary rows these chunks use, and for each chunk its scaffold and the editor's
apparatus for its pages. Work so as to use few tool calls:

1. Read this brief once (it is the only file you need to read, unless the card names one for your chunk).
2. For each chunk, write the COMPLETE chunk file ONCE with the Write tool to its path (given in the chunk's
   header below): the scaffold with `status: translated`, the title, the English after every Latin block,
   headings and side-notes as the card says, Notes, and Transcription notes, in the card's
   layout. Never alter the Latin. Do not make a series of small edits.
3. Use the apparatus given here for variants (the card's rule: a variant that gives the sense is translated
   with a T note citing the siglum; otherwise translate the print and flag it). Open a plate image only if a
   word cannot be construed at all from the print plus the apparatus; otherwise flag it as a Latin doubt.
4. Scripture: quote the Douay-Rheims as you know it. At the END, check every reference you quoted in ONE
   command: `cd /Users/wilsonpruitt/wyclif && .venv/bin/python scripts/w3/bible.py "Ref 1" "Ref 2" ...` and fix any wording
   that differs, in the same chunk file (this is the one allowed round of edits).
5. Run `cd /Users/wilsonpruitt/wyclif && .venv/bin/python scripts/w3/lint.py chunks/eucharistia/wyc-eucharistia-08-b.md chunks/eucharistia/wyc-eucharistia-08-c.md chunks/eucharistia/wyc-eucharistia-08-d.md` once and fix what it reports.
6. Final message: per chunk, the ledger rows (table: id | chunk / note | claim | status | how / next step),
   glossary proposals, Latin doubts, and a one-line note of anything the coordinator must decide.

Standing rules (from the *De ecclesia* briefs, 2026-10-02):
- Do NOT search the Patrologia or other sources; a separate checker verifies them afterwards. Give the
  editor's reference, the modern form in the English, and "to be checked" with a fresh LEDGER id per item
  (never reuse an id).
- Notes open with their bold class codes, `**S/C.**`, never bare letters mid-note. No process words in
  the notes ("the report", "the coordinator", "brief").
- OCR scars (stray English or margin letters, line numbers read as words, glued or broken words,
  numerals read as letters) stay out of the chunk: translate the print's word and list each scar in your
  final message only (page.line, token, likely print reading). The coordinator fixes the Latin.
- Flag every place the established Latin may have LOST a word (it does not construe, especially at a page
  head or foot) or DOUBLED one: page.line and the suspicion. Translate the print as it stands; supply a
  missing word only in brackets with a T note. The editor's print governs; list any departure.


## The working card

# TRANSLATOR CARD — one *De eucharistia* chunk

This card replaces reading CONVENTIONS, the pilot and Thakkar in full: it is their working core.
Adapted from `chunks/potestate-pape/CARD.md` (Loserth's other volume) with the B+ lessons of
`chunks/incarnacione/CARD.md` (2026-11-06; **reviewed 2026-11-06** on `prol-a`: `_review/REVIEW-prol-a.md`). Read it, then `GLOSSARY.md`,
then your scaffold (or your brief, which carries all three). Consult CONVENTIONS.md only when the card sends
you there. Work in `~/wyclif`. Wyclif is approached with **daggers drawn**: the most recent English
versions were "worse than useless" because of four error classes (below). Your English must survive
a hostile reader with the Latin open.

## Work lean (cost is per tool call: each call re-sends your whole context)

1. One call reading what you need (the brief, or CARD + GLOSSARY + scaffold).
2. **One** `bible.py` call with every scripture reference you need (it takes many refs).
3. Plates **only** for a Latin doubt the print plus apparatus cannot settle.
4. Write each finished chunk in **one** Write of the whole file (Latin blocks copied unchanged).
5. Lint once; fix; done. Draft in your head, not in the file.

## The volume

*Tractatus de eucharistia* and *Tractatus de penitencia sive de confessione*, ed. Johann Loserth (Wyclif
Society, 1892), from the plates of archive.org `latinworks13wycl` (**leaf = page + 71**; leaf images in
`text/eucharistia/raw/leaves/`). Three texts:

Chunk ids: `prol-a … prol-c` the compendium, `01-a … 09-n` the nine chapters, `pen01 … pen06` *De
penitencia*, `quest` the *Questio*.

- **pp. 1–10, the compendium** (*Sentencia tractatus de Eukaristia in compendio*, under "Prologus"): a
  medieval summary of the nine chapters that came down with the work. Translate it like the text.
- **pp. 11–326, the *Tractatus de eucharistia* (maior)**, nine long chapters. Written in Wyclif's last
  years, before 1382–83 (Loserth, Introd. §4: it shares passages word for word with *Sermones* III, and
  it avoids the words *substancia* and *materialis* of the bread, which Wyclif says in *Sermo* III.54 he
  has stopped using). Wyclif's case against the "modern" doctrine: that the consecrated host is in its
  nature bread and wine and sacramentally, figuratively, the body and blood of Christ; that an accident
  without a subject is impossible; that the decree *Ego Berengarius* (*De cons.* D. 2 c. 42) is the
  faith of the ancient Roman church; against the friars, Thomas, Scotus and "the sect of the signs".
  A **treatise**: Wyclif speaks in the first person, states conclusions, raises objections and answers
  them. The tractatus minor (the *Confessio*) is NOT in this volume (Shirley, *Fasc. Ziz.*).
- **pp. 327–348, *De eucharistia et penitencia sive de confessione*** in six chapters (only ch. 1 is on
  the eucharist; the rest is penance and auricular confession), then the short ***Questio ad fratres de
  sacramento altaris*** (pp. 347–348, its first part only: Loserth notes that the rest of the
  manuscript's text is not on the sacrament, and is Hus's).

**Sigla. ⚠ They differ between the two works.** *De eucharistia* (Introd. §5): **A** Vienna 3927;
**B** Vienna 3932; **C** Vienna 1387 ("the best of the three" Vienna MSS, correcting A and B); **D** Prague
Univ. IV D 22 (1404–05, Andreas of Kouřim); **E** Prague Univ. XI E 3 (1460; Loserth: "the best and most
reliable text of all the five"). Loserth's lettering "does not in any way refer to their respective
value". The Vienna MSS are one group, the Prague MSS another. *De penitencia* (Introd. §6): **A** Vienna
3927; **B** Bautzen, Gersdorf Library M. St. 80.7; **C** Vienna 1337; **D** Prague Univ. III G 11; **E**
Vienna 3980; **F** Vienna 4527. Cite variants with the sigla of the work you are in. Marginal notes in the
manuscripts that Loserth prints ("F in marg.", "DB in marg.") are reception: an **R** note where they
show how a reader took the text.

**The page foot** (in your brief as "apparatus", by page) has two blocks, both keyed to the **line**:
the variants (`19. C: ecclesie in marg. alia manu.`) and Loserth's source references. The OCR of it is
rough: read it for sense, not letter by letter, and read the plate foot where a variant matters.

## The job

The Latin in your scaffold is **established and frozen** (blind transcription of the plates, checked word
by word against a four-scan vote; residue read on the plate). Fill `[TITLE]` (short, lower case: "the
three opinions on the quiddity of the host"), each `[ENGLISH]`, the notes and the transcription notes;
set `status: translated`; lint; report.

- **Headings:** keep `## ¶k · range` exactly. **Never change a range; never split a paragraph.**
- **Never alter the Latin.** A transcription error you find (a stray mark, a broken word, a side-note
  word in the text) is REPORTED, never repaired in your file: the coordinator repairs the transcription
  (`text/eucharistia/bt/pNNN.txt`) and refreshes the chunk's Latin. A word that looks wrong: read the
  apparatus for that line first; then, if still doubtful, the plate (`text/eucharistia/raw/leaves/nLEAF.jpg`,
  LEAF = page + 71 padded to four digits: p. 1 = `n0072.jpg`). A variant that gives the sense → translate
  it + **T** note citing the siglum; a compelling emendation → translate it + **T** note "(our
  emendation)"; neither → translate the print and flag it. Never smooth nonsense into sense. Report every
  such case. **Loserth's printed text governs** (ruled 2026-10-02 for Loserth's volumes; the
  manuscripts-outrank-the-print rule is Harris's volumes only): translate it, his own emendations
  included, unless it will not construe; a manuscript reading is chosen only then, or where the source
  Wyclif quotes, read this session, agrees with it. Every departure gets a T note giving both readings.
- **The compendia (`prol-a … prol-c`) summarise chapters whose Latin is already established** in this
  directory. Where the compendium's ellipsis leaves a construal open (whose argument, which *per* phrase is a
  ground and which a means), grep the chapter's `>` blocks, follow them, and cite the page in the **C** note:
  that is construal, not source verification, and one call. (`prol-a` 2.1–5: the three decrees are the
  objections' grounds, ch. 1 pp. 24, 25, 28.)
- **English layout:** `[N]` at the same word as `[p. N]` in the Latin (the chunk's first `[p. N]` is
  implicit). Supplied words in `[brackets]`, sparingly, ⛔ never in italics. **Quotations** (a quotation running on across ¶s or into the next chunk opens each ¶ with a double quote and closes only at its end; quotations inside it take single quotes) in quotation
  marks. Your brief carries Loserth's **italic runs** per page where the scan's OCR gives them (rough;
  ⚠ page numbers drift: a run not in your page's Latin belongs to a neighbouring page): they are
  the editor's judgement of where a quotation runs, not the manuscript's: follow them by default, depart
  where the source shows otherwise (say so in a note). Reviews do not check quotation bounds against the
  italics. Italicised scripture inside indirect speech is quoted too; where quoting would garble the
  sentence, leave it unquoted and give the reference in an **S** note.
- **Ordinals:** a degree-sign ordinal can print or OCR like a two-digit number (*30 et 10* = 3° and 1°).
  Read both forms the same way, and check the plate when a citation looks impossible.
- **Formulae of the disputation** (ruled 2026-10-01; fixed renderings, tagged only where GLOSSARY has a
  row): *instatur* "it is objected" · *obicitur* "it is objected" · *arguitur* "it is argued" (with
  *per*: GLOSSARY) · *dicitur* "it is said" (in an answer: "the answer is") · *respondetur* "the reply is"
  · *conclusio* "conclusion" · *antecedens / consequens* "antecedent / consequent" · *consequencia*
  "inference", ⛔ never "consequence" · *patet* "it is clear" · *supponitur* "it is supposed" ·
  *probatur* "proof:" or "it is proved" · *confirmatur* "this is confirmed" · *solvit / dissolvit* (an objection) "resolves", both (never "answers", which belongs to *respondetur / dicitur*).
- **A source note says only what the Latin says about the source** (who narrates, which book, which work)
  and leaves the rest to the ledger: never supply a story the Latin rules out (*narratum a beato Gregorio*:
  Gregory narrates).
- **Citation formulae:** *ubi supra* "in the place cited above" (⛔ never a claim about where a passage
  stands), *ut supra* "as above", *infra* "below". *Utrobique* "on both sides / in both places".

## The four error classes (Thakkar) — check every sentence

1. **Terms:** GLOSSARY.md governs, one term one rendering. Tag the **first occurrence in the chunk** of
   every §A–C term: `[accident]{g:accidens}`; a multi-word key is lower case with hyphens, `{g:corpus-christi}`, `{g:a-simili}` (lint rejects spaces); never nest brackets inside a tag (`[form [sounds] with]{g:k}` breaks the site): tag the bare word. The key must exist in GLOSSARY.md. A term that looks
   technical but has no row: render it sensibly, untagged, and propose it in your report.
   **CONTEXTUAL** rows hold two senses English splits: choose by context and write a **C** note at the
   first occurrence in the chunk and wherever it leans to the other sense (the dikaiosune rule,
   CONVENTIONS §6).
   Rows that already exist and bear on this volume: *accidens* "accident" · *accidens absolutum*
   "absolute accident" · *transsubstanciacio* "transubstantiation" · *conficere* "consecrate (the
   eucharist)" · *figura / figuratum* "figure / thing figured" · *res sacramenti* "reality of the
   sacrament" · *sacramentalia* "sacramentals" · *quantus* "quantified" · *per se / per accidens* "of
   itself / by accident" · *sensibile commune* "common sensible" · *ecclesia* church (**lower-case**) ·
   *caritas* charity · *sentencia* teaching (and *sentencia verborum* "sense", a separate row) · *ex fide* as faith teaches ·
   *opinio* opinion · *novelli* the newer [doctors] · *sancti* the saints · *concludere* infer ("conclude" only where a
   conclusion is literally drawn) · *deduccio* deduction · *maneries* kind · *principaliter* as a main head ·
   *sensibilis* perceptible · *declarare / ostendere* make clear / show · *ecclesia* is tagged at its first
   occurrence in every chunk.
   **This volume's vocabulary is now ruled (2026-11-06, `prol-a` review):** *sacramentum* (the eucharist) ·
   *hostia* host · *panis / vinum* bread / wine · *calix* chalice · *corpus Christi / Domini* kept apart ·
   *remanencia* the remaining · *accidens sine subiecto* · *substancia · quantitas · qualitas* · *esse /
   esse sacramentale* being / sacramental being · *esus / manducacio* eating · *confeccio* consecration ·
   *secta signorum* · *novella / antiqua ecclesia* · *predicacio ydemptica / tropica* identical / tropical
   predication. **The mode adverbs, one word each, never merged, each tagged at first occurrence:**
   *sacramentaliter* sacramentally · *realiter* really (never "actually") · *vere* truly (never "really") ·
   *spiritualiter* spiritually · *virtualiter* virtually · *figurative* figuratively · *tropice* tropically ·
   *ydemptice* identically · *invisibiliter* invisibly · *sensibiliter* perceptibly · *corporaliter* bodily ·
   *substancialiter* substantially · *dimensionaliter* dimensionally. A term still missing a row (*ydemptificacio*,
   *conversio*, *fractio*, *confessio auricularis*, *absolucio*, *claves* …): render it sensibly, untagged, and
   propose it. *Ego Berengarius* stays as the decree's title (Wyclif's spelling *Beringarius* in the Latin;
   "Berengar" for the man in the English). In ch. 1, *res sacramenti* "reality of the sacrament" is a ruled
   row: the compendium's *de rebus huius sacramenti* (1.3) is the three-membered distinction the chapter sets
   out, so keep its *res* consistent with that row.
2. **Connectives carry the argument.** ⛔ Never omit one, never turn one into filler.

   | Latin | English | Never |
   |---|---|---|
   | enim, nam | for | "now", "indeed" |
   | ergo, igitur, ideo | therefore, so, then | "now", "and", "indeed" |
   | sed / autem, marking the **minor premiss or next step** | now | (omitted) |
   | sed / autem, adversative | but | (omitted) |
   | autem, continuative | and | (omitted), and **not "now"** |
   | cum (concessive / causal) | although / since | "whenever" |
   | tamen | yet, nevertheless | "therefore" |
   | item | again, also | "now" |
   | vero (continuative) | and; but (adversative) | "now", "truly" |
   | verumtamen | nevertheless | "but truly" |
   | unde | hence, so | "whence" (archaic), "where" |
   | per idem | by the same token | "in the same way" |
   | ymmo | indeed, rather (correcting upward) | (omitted) |
   | patet; constat | it is clear; it is evident | |

   "Now" is reserved for the minor premiss, or the step that brings a new premiss to bear. An *autem*
   that only extends the same step is "and". ⚠ The commonest error in *De ecclesia* (close-out, ~50 of
   69 connective fixes): a *sed* that brings the minor premiss of a syllogism closed by *ergo / ideo /
   igitur* rendered "but". Before writing "but" for a *sed*, look ahead for the *ergo*: if one follows,
   it is "now".
3. **Ordinary words with a medieval sense:** GLOSSARY §D; look up any word whose classical and
   Wyclifite senses may differ, and propose additions.
4. **Syntax:** construe before rendering (main verb, subject, what every relative and genitive hangs
   on). Keep quantifier order where it is meaning. Keep Wyclif's long periods where English tolerates
   them. **A doubtful construal is never chosen silently:** translate the likelier reading and write a
   **C** note giving the alternative.
   ⚠ **Predication is the matter here, as in *De incarnacione*.** *Hoc est corpus meum*, *panis est
   corpus Christi*, *hoc sacramentum est panis*: Wyclif argues about what the pronoun demonstrates and
   in what mode the predicate holds. Keep subject and predicate in his order, keep *est* as "is" (never
   "exists", "becomes" or "represents" unless the Latin says so), and keep the mode adverb where he puts
   it (*est sacramentaliter corpus Christi* "is sacramentally the body of Christ"). ⛔ Never soften "is"
   into "signifies" or harden "figuratively" into "really": the difference is the treatise's matter.
   Demonstrative pronouns (*hoc*, *istud*) under discussion: render "this", and keep their gender
   visible in a C note where the argument turns on it (*hoc* neuter against *hic*, 348).
   **Propositions in indirect speech** whose sense is under discussion: render as the quoted proposition
   ("who say 'this is an accident without a subject'"), not "who say that …", which asserts it.

## Scripture

`python3 scripts/w3/bible.py "I Cor 10:16"` (Vulgate + Douay–Rheims; psalms in Vulgate numbering) or
`python3 scripts/w3/bible.py --find "panis quem frangimus"`. Where Wyclif's Latin agrees with the
Clementine Vulgate, use the **Douay–Rheims wording**. Where he departs, translate *his* Latin and write
an **S** note giving the Vulgate. Modern references in the English (1 Cor. 10:16). The chapter numbers
are Wyclif's, the verse numbers Loserth's (the headnote says so once).

## Notes

- `[^n]` from 1, the marker placed in the same edit as its note, each opening with a type letter **with a
  full stop** (`**C.**`; the site strips only that form): **T** text · **C** construal · **G** glossary
  (passage-specific only; otherwise a tag) · **S** source · **R** reception/context (a manuscript's
  marginal note Loserth prints; Hus's or the Hussites' reuse where Loserth notes it). A note that does two
  jobs takes the combined code (`**S/T.**`, `**C/S.**`; lint accepts it). The first occurrence of a CONTEXTUAL
  row in each chunk (*sentencia*, *inconveniens*) always gets its **C** note.
- **Density: about one note per 70–100 Latin words**, fewer where the text is plain. Short, factual,
  says what the Latin does and stops. No modern theology, no evaluation, ⛔ no judgement on whose
  eucharistic doctrine is right.
- **Every identification** other than scripture checked with bible.py gets a ledger row in your report
  with a status: `editor` (Loserth's source reference at the page foot), `to-verify` (from memory: every
  patristic, scholastic or canon-law identification you did not read in this session), `verified` (you
  read the source text this session: say where; local PL at `~/patrologia/sources/pl/tei/`). ⛔ Never
  pass memory off as verified. Id `K<chunk>-<n>` (`K01a-1`; ⚠ `K`, since `E` is *De ecclesia*, `P`
  *De potestate pape*, `I` *De incarnacione*), cited in the note: "(LEDGER K01a-1)". Loserth's references
  to the *Corpus iuris canonici* are `editor`; give them in modern form (*De cons.* D. 2 c. 42) and say
  the form is ours. Expect above all: Gratian *De consecratione* D. 2 (*Ego Berengarius*, c. 42;
  Augustine and Ambrose there), Augustine (*In Ioh.*, *De civ. Dei*, sermons), Ambrose *De sacramentis*
  and *De mysteriis*, Hilary, Jerome, Bernard, Thomas (*ST* III qq. 73–83; *In IV Sent.*), Scotus,
  the Lombard *Sent.* IV d. 8–13, Grosseteste.

## Model of register

`pilots/wyc-ecclesia-01a.md` (De ecclesia pp. 1–5) is a reviewed model of register and note style: read
it for that only (it predates some GLOSSARY rulings; **GLOSSARY governs**). **The first chunk, `prol-a`** (the compendium), carries
the `## Headnote` for the whole volume; `pen01` carries a short headnote for *De penitencia* and `quest` one for the
*Questio* (date, sigla, Loserth's remarks on the text). The headnote ⛔ is **not** the card's thesis paragraph: "The move" is how the compendium *builds* the case, chapter by chapter, and names no adversary the chunk does not name; the date is given as Loserth's evidence plus the modern dating, each `[verify]`. The headnote (CONVENTIONS §12 order: occasion, text, the work's move, where it is answered; date,
editor, the two works and their sigla, the compendium, the *Questio*), each unverified claim marked
`[verify]`.

## Transcription notes

The variant list is either complete against the page-foot apparatus or headed "selected"; none that affects the
English may be left out. Plate readings and fixes to the Latin (stray stops that were ink flecks) are recorded
there.

## Side-notes

Already read against the plates (WORKFLOW 5, `text/eucharistia/sidenotes.fixed.tsv`) and placed in your
scaffold's section. ⛔ Do not edit them. One that is plainly wrong (garbled, or at the wrong line):
report it under Latin doubts as `side-note page.line`.

## Finish

1. `status: translated` in the front matter (nothing else changes there).
2. `.venv/bin/python scripts/w3/lint.py chunks/eucharistia/<your chunk>.md` until clean.
3. The four-class check above, sentence by sentence.
4. ⛔ Edit **only your chunk(s)**. No git, no other files. Everything shared goes in your report.

## Report (≤ 200 words per chunk, exactly these heads)

- **Chunk:** id, Latin words, notes.
- **Ledger rows:** in LEDGER.md's table format `| id | chunk / note | claim | status | how / next step |`.
- **Glossary proposals:** Latin · proposed English · where · why.
- **Latin doubts:** page.line · printed · suspicion · settled on the plate?

## Glossary (the 448 rows these chunks use; the full file is GLOSSARY.md)

# GLOSSARY — FROZEN 2026-09-28 (Wilson's pilot review)

*One Latin term, one English rendering, every time, across the whole corpus. A reader must be able
to recognise the same word coming back, because Wyclif's arguments turn on it. A rendering changes
only by a dated decision in CONVENTIONS' decision log, never silently in a chunk. Entries may be
*added* by recorded decision as new terms appear. **Tag keys:** a chunk tags a term as
`[English]{g:latin-form}` (CONVENTIONS §11), and the key must match a Latin form in one of the rows
below. These rows are also the source of the site's hover glossary. Where a term has two senses,
the entry says so and each chunk's note picks one. A term marked **CONTEXTUAL** holds together
senses English splits: its English is chosen by context, under the dikaiosune rule (CONVENTIONS §6).*

**Sources of the decisions.** "Pilot" = settled in `pilots/` this session. "T. p. N" = Mark
Thakkar, "Duces caecorum," *Vivarium* 58 (2020), page N (`reference/`), which documents the
errors of the two most recent translations. His corrections are adopted here unless an entry says
otherwise.

**Orthography.** Headwords are given in the Society editions' medieval spelling (*eciam*,
*racio*, *quiditas*, *ymmo*), because that is what the translator will meet on the page.

## A. The church

| Latin | English | Note |
|---|---|---|
| ecclesia | church | Lower-case in English except in a proper title. |
| ecclesia militans / triumphans / dormiens | the church militant / triumphant / sleeping | *Dormiens* = the souls in purgatory. Not "dormant". |
| pars peregrinans; peregrinari | the pilgrim part; to be a pilgrim | Augustine's *peregrinatio* (Ench. 56). Pilot. |
| predestinatus, -i | the predestinate (sg. "a predestinate [person]") | Never "the elect", which is *electi* and gets "the elect". |
| prescitus, -i | **the foreknown** | ⭐ Wyclif's technical term for those God foreknows will be damned. It is **not** "the reprobate" (*reprobi* → "the reprobate"). Explain it in a note at its first occurrence in **each work**. The English word misleads on its own and Penn explains it only once (T. p. 361 n. 12). Pilot. |
| via / patria | the way / the homeland | *Beatitudo patrie* → "the blessedness of the homeland". Pilot. The earthly sense (one's native country) is also "homeland"; a note where it matters (*Dial.* 54.2). |
| sponsa / sponsus | bride / bridegroom | |
| corpus Christi misticum | the mystical body of Christ | |
| mater nostra | our mother | Church as mother is the governing figure of *De ecclesia* I. |
| fides explicita / implicita | explicit faith / implicit faith | The scholastic pair (*Dial.* 28.16–17). Ruled 2026-09-28. |
| infidelis | unbeliever; with a dative, faithless (to) | Two senses by construction. Pairs with *infidelitas*, unbelief. Ruled 2026-09-28 (10 sites). |
| Christicole | worshippers of Christ | Ruled 2026-09-28. |
| litere fraternitatum | letters of fraternity | Friars' letters admitting a benefactor to the order's suffrages. Ruled 2026-09-28 (4 sites). |
| ecclesiastici | CONTEXTUAL: clergy / those who belong to the church | Usually the clergy; where Wyclif means every member of the church (*Eccl.* 81.4) render "those who belong to the church" and write a **C** note. Ruled 2026-10-02. |
| ecclesia laycalis / secularis | the lay church / the secular church | Ruled 2026-10-02 (154.15, 156.3). |
| sacramentum (the eucharist); sacramentum altaris | sacrament; the sacrament of the altar | The plain sense, against the Augustinian row (*Incarn.*). Ruled 2026-11-06 (coordinator, delegated; *Euch.* prol-a 1.3, 3.30). |
| hostia; hostia consecrata | host; consecrated host | Ruled 2026-11-06 (coordinator, delegated; *Euch.* prol-a 1.11, 1.22). |

# *De eucharistia*, chapter 8, part 2: [TITLE]

## ¶1 · 236.31–237.2

> [p. 236] Ex quibus omnibus infertur possibilitas existencie eiusdem corporis per diversa loca et quod idem [p. 237] corpus quocienscunque libuerit potest esse per eundem locum.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶2 · 237.3–237.9

> [p. 237] Sed contra istud replicatur primo per hoc quod tale corpus est solum semel per datum locum, cum postquam semel intravit illum nunquam exivit, ut suppono. Sicut ergo non quociens comedisti, tociens fuisti homo (ut dicunt loyci), eo quod semel es homo continue, ita videtur dicendum quod solum semel es in isto loco.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶3 · 237.10–237.16

> [p. 237] Confirmatur ex hoc quod aliter infinicies foret omne corpus in loco, quia infinicies posset extrahi de loco ipso remanente continue in eodem et tociens est in loco; quocienscunque namque Deus extraheret eum de loco aliquo, tociens inveniret eum in illo; quod non foret, nisi tociens Deus poneret illum in eodem.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶4 · 237.17–237.21

> [p. 237] Loquamur autem de aliquo modo, non ut dicit vicissitudinem temporis, sed ut dicit multitudinem ordinis naturalis; et tunc oportet dicere quod Deus non potest ponere creaturam alicubi nisi ponat infinicies eam ibi.

## ¶5 · 237.22–237.27

> [p. 237] Similiter, videtur quod omnis materialis substancia sit infinitum rara et cum hoc infinitum densa, quia tociens posset poni per locum datum quod foret infinitum densa, et ita densa est modo, et per idem foret infinitum rara in casu quo Deus infinicies ipsam extraheret.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶6 · 237.28–237.32

> [p. 237] Similiter, videtur quod omne corpus qualitate intensum et remissum sit tam infinitum intensum quam remissum, quia per multitudinem et subtraccionem sui a se ipso posset precise cum eadem qualitate esse huius.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶7 · 238.1–239.14

> [p. 238] Item, videtur quod omne corpus sit infinitum in quacumque denominacione sua corporea; nam corpus potest esse infinitum sine acquisicione alicuius quantitatis preter illam quantam habet et quantumcunque magnum potest esse cum illis paribus, ita magnum est modo: ergo omne corpus est infinitum. Consequencia patet ex hoc quod omnem quantitatem quam potest habere cum illis paribus habet modo. Et assumptum probatur capiendo A cubum pedalem tunc multiplicato eo per sex loca in quibus tangat se secundum sex superficies varias et fiat continuacio, et patet quod A equivalet sextipedali quadrangulo sine hoc quod aliqua quantitas generetur secundum se totam; pono iterum quod quelibet secunda pars proporcionalis istius A cum toto residuo multiplicetur per duodecim loca et fiat continuacio secundum superficies dispares, et patet quod A equivalebit uni corpori duplo ad sextipedale, et sic in infinitum secundum omnem dimensionem, petito hoc principio: si sint duo quanta et unum superpositum reliquo, nec excedit nec exceditur ab eodem, tunc illa sunt equalia. A enim est equale loco vel situi per quem sic extenditur. Nec valet dicere quod generatur nova quantitas, quia nulla generatur secundum se totam, sicut non generatur in A superficies, punctus vel linea. Cum ergo penes multiplicacionem punctualium attenditur maioritas quantitatis, patet quod A non maioratur in casu posito, et per idem non minoraretur ipso iterum demultiplicato, ymmo coextensa una medietate A cum sua quantitate cum reliqua, et sic in infinitum usque ad situm punctale, videtur quod tam [p. 239] A quam sua quantitas manebit continue eque magna, quia nullam quantitatem deperdet sed aliquam per accidens acquiret. Ex quo videtur quod nullam magnitudinem acquiret vel perdet, et sic omne quantum foret infinitum magnum et infinitum parvum, ymmo tantus mundus ut est iste et infinitum maior posset constitui per punctale. Quis ergo scit utrum sit ita de facto, cum brevius cum punctali materia posset fieri quoad beatitudinem vel aliquem per se finem; nec racio vel experiencia convincit oppositum. Quomodo ergo poneretur a philosopho cui non sit revelacio tanta multitudo rerum superflua per verbum Dei abbreviatum quod conpendiosissime ordinat media ad fines quos intendit?

[ENGLISH]

## ¶8 · 239.15–239.29

> [p. 239] Item, per hanc viam tolleretur omnis mensura loci, sicut et omnis species figurarum, nam si Deus potest multiplicare sic generaliter idem corpus in numero, potest et multiplicare generaliter situm, locum et figuram. Nec scimus quando sic faciat, cum foret plus compendiosum, plus philosophicum et plus undique racioni consonum, si foret possibile; Deus ergo multiplicans situm punctalem per totum mundum non posset compendiosius locare aliquid, quia viso fundamento ipse foret locus cuilibet creature et sic posset esse ad terram omnia in omnibus. Concesso ergo isto videtur piimo quod omnis locus sit indivisibilis et per consequens nullus maior reliquo; situs enim indivisibilis multiplicatus foret omnis locus. Ex quo videtur quod nichil sit maius reliquo quoad molem.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶9 · 239.30–240.2

> [p. 239] Secundo videtur sequi quod nichil posset cum illis paribus moveri localiter et foret plena illusio sensuum quoad omnem sensacionem et specialiter quoad visum; corpora enim naturalia haberent locacionem [p. 240] suam naturalem et visum secundum quem causarent apparenciam motus.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶10 · 240.3–240.10

> [p. 240] Tercio videtur sequi repugnancia in terminis, cum solum per situm individualem non multiplicatum sit posicio cuiuscunque. Quomodo ergo multiplicatur situs per totum mundum, cum omnis situs sit ubique, quia in isto situ indivisibili? et tolleretur omnis differencia posicionis et per consequens omne signum diei vel noctis, omnis figura hominis et consequentur infiniti errores in illis; quorum opposita implicantur.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶11 · 240.12–240.30

> [p. 240] Quantum ad differencias figurarum patet quod ille presupponunt differenciam situs que tollitur; nam signato A triangulo qui sit medietas quadrati et multiplicato ipso per duo loca immediata sic quod applicetur unum extremum basis A ad aliud extremum eiusdem basis, ita quod fiat ad omnem eius punctum continuacio, patet quod annichilata reliqua medietate fieret unum quadratum, et sic quantumcunque magna figura et cuiuscunque speciei potest esse eciam per solum punctum multiplicatum; nam multiplicato A puncto per omnem situm punctalem qui iam est in mundo, et annichilato toto residuo, patet quod nullibi deficiet situs vel figura. Et patet inanitas responsionis qua dicitur quod non constituitur figura nisi per quantitatem secundum se totam non multiplicatam, quia si eadem persona potest multiplicari, replendo situs eque sicut tot homines, per idem eadem quantitas et figura, quia aliter non foret multiplicacio sed persone per unum situm posicio.

# *De eucharistia*, chapter 8, part 3: [TITLE]

## ¶1 · 240.31–241.22

> [p. 240] Item, suppono quod A punctus multiplicetur per omnem situm mundi annichilato toto residuo, patet quod adhuc superest materia movendi localiter, sicut [p. 241] Petrus constituendo coream per viam multiplicacionis, aliter esset persona multiplicata nimis cathenata, nisi ubicunque fuerit posset movere se localiter et facere quascunque acciones corporeas ad suam potenciam naturalem; et omnem operacionem huiusmodi quam potest corpus naturale multiplicatum facere potest quantitas plene qualificata multiplicata facere, ut patet de hostia consecrata; et per idem Deus potest a maxima multiplicata usque ad minimam facere cum omni multiplicato tantum quantum fit cum aliquo, quia aliter derogaretur divine potencie. Moveat ergo Deus totum equinoccialem circulum causando regulariter motum et tempus ut modo, sic tamen quod in tota equinocciali sit solum A punctus multiplicatus, et videtur primo quod per totum A non est motus, quia quiescit in utroque polo, et alibi non est situs, cum omnis situs multiplicatur ubilibet, ut suppono, et si non sit variacio motus, non est variacio temporis vel instantis, cum tempus vel instans quod est passio motus non variaretur vel individuaretur nisi a motu; et perirent dies, anni et omnia tempora, sicut recitatum est in tractatu De Tempore.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶2 · 241.23–243.7

> [p. 241] Et conformiter fantasiatur ponendo quod Deus cum quolibet instanti ponat infinita instancia et cum quolibet tempore infinita tempora equalia non communicancia; et tunc videtur quod omne durans per tempus infinitum diu durat, quia per infinitum magnum tempus, eo quod per infinitum multa tempora equalia non communicancia, quod equivalet. Ymmo videtur quod Deus ex duobus coextensis potest constituere [p. 242] unum tempus, sicut ex duabus superficiebus, sitibus vel actibus eiusdem speciei parcialiter componibilibus potest constituere tercium compositum, et sic sicut nemo sciret utrum infinitum diu durabit, sic nesciret utrum velociter movebitur vel immediate post hoc erit dies iudicii propter multiplicacionem temporis et propter tempora et loca abscondita; et periret in toto mundo noticia sensibilium et per consequens omnis sciencia, cum omnis homo tamquam vertiginosus nesciret discernere de quocunque sensibili. Et omnium istorum errorum origo est mendacium fictum de sacramento altaris. Non enim finget cultor accidentis quod potencia Dei terminatur ad tantum mirabile quod potest facere et non ultra, vel quod sic est de facto quoad mundum et alia sensibilia et non modo infinitum magis mirabili nobis abscondito, et sic redirent opiniones antique, ut loquitur Aristoteles primo Ethicorum et specialiter quod omnis homo nichil scit sed solummodo opinatur; et cum vacuum non foret nisi qualitas carens materiali substancia, quilibet cultor accidencium ignorat si per totum mundum sit vacuum eciam infinitum, et sic rectificando in infinitum corticem interceptam inter duas lineas girativas in corulo columpnari deveniretur demum ad partem proporcionalem ultimam coruli et ad ultimum pedale linee girative; et oporteret dare ubi est extremum alterum, cum dato situato dandus est situs, sicut et dandus foret, ubi sit sor qui infigatur continue in extremo corticis moto. Sic enim dicitur quod servando ligulam secundum eius extrema in manibus distantibus fixis continue et rarefacta illa in infinitum atque correspondenter girata super corpus columpnare interceptum inter manus quod circumgiretur proporcionaliter [p. 243] ut ligula exigit se circumvolvi; quo facto foret ligula infinita et tamen secundum eius ambo extrema in manibus tuis tenta; mille sunt casus quibus perturbatur ecclesia, qui omnes dependent sive fundantur super fantasia maxime inpossibili atque heretica occasione materie de sacramento eukaristie introducta.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶3 · 243.8–243.22

> [p. 243] Ideo (ut sepe dixi) doctor katholicus debet servare se in limitibus nature, asserendo quod solum Deus est potencie infinite, sic quod nec mundus nec creatura aliqua poterit esse infinitum magna, nec infinitum magnum poterit esse tale, et sic in assumptis argumentorum negetur iste saltus et sic in infinitum. Admitterem tamen omnes tales casus, docto quod subiacerent divine potencie, et sic negatur esse numerum infinitum, sicut negatur quantitas continua infinita, ut patet in materia de composicione continui ex non quantis et in materia de tempore. Illud enim cuius quantitas est nobis incognita vocamus ad modum loquendi scripture et philosophi equivoce infinitum, et sic negatur talis multiplicacio corporis et alii casus infundabiles in scriptura.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶4 · 243.23–243.31

> [p. 243] Sed pro multiplicacione communiter sic arguitur: Non magis repugnat idem corpus in numero multiplicari simul per diversa loca quam repugnat diversa corpora situari simul per eundem locum eis adequatum, cum tanta sit utrobique distancia atque diversitas sed secundum est satis possibile, ut patet de corporibus glorificatis secundum dotem subtilitatis coextensis et de elementis immixtis: ergo et primum est per idem possibile.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶5 · 243.32–244.6

> [p. 243] Confirmatur secundo ex miraculis quibus narratur experiri idem corpus sic simul dimensionaliter multiplicari, [p. 244] ut narratur de beato Ambrosio ipsum fuisse pro eodem tempore in locis distantibus et officium ecclesiasticum celebrasse; sicut enim idem corpus potest multiplicari per diversa tempora, sic et per diversa loca. Et tercio confirmatur ex evidenciis tactis in tercio argumento ex fide scripture.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶6 · 244.7–244.16

> [p. 244] Quantum ad istud, dicitur quod maior sit falsa, cum necesse sit corpora commixta occupare situs individuales correspondenter positos secundum sua indivisibilia, et ita dos subtilitatis facit ad penetracionem, non ad divisionem vel coextensionem, et sic post diem iudicii erit celum quoad locum extensius versus terram, correspondenter ut habebit plura punctalia de spera sublunari vel elementari, sic quod venter celi gravidabitur, servando figuram (ut hic supponitur).

# *De eucharistia*, chapter 8, part 4: [TITLE]

## ¶1 · 244.17–245.23

> [p. 244] Et idem est iudicium de quantitate et qualitate coextensis cum materiali essencia. Si enim quantitas, qualitas, forma et materia haberent per se dimensiones, sicut habet materialis substancia (ut fantasiatur error predictus de eukaristia), tunc forent quatuor quantitates preter quantitatem communem coextense per quinque loca coextensa, et quantitas cum suo loco esset prius quoad consequenciam quam alia loca vel alie quantitates quatuor sequentes, quia (ut fantasiatur) quantitas cum suo loco posset esse vacuum sine aliqua aliorum quatuor, non econtra, et (ut videtur michi) tunc foret locus mundi diminutus, cum deficerent quatuor communitatis multitudines individualium; aliud enim foret unam istarum quinque rerum per se situari et aliud aliam sic situari, [p. 245] cum Deus posset annichilare posterius (ut inquiunt) servato priori; vel enim oportet dare materialem substanciam sine tali quantitate limitata vel si hoc non potest contingere, tunc quantitas talis est longe prior materiali substancia. Deus enim (ut inquiunt) potest miraculose servare quantitatem sine materiali substancia, non econtra, et sic videtur quod ad omnem punctum mundi relictum foret infinitum multum de vacuo, cum Deus (ut inquiunt) posset ponere in situ istius mundi infinita corpora et alia que poterunt per se esse infinitum disparium specierum et cuilibet illorum oporteret dare locum proprium. Non enim est locus prius natura quam corporalis substancia sed econtra, ideo non est possibile eundem locum in numero suscipere vicissim quotlibet species materialis substancie, formarum substancialium et accidentalium, quia tunc foret locus vacuum; quod Deus non posset movere precedens omnia ista. Sed quid stulcius aut infidelius. Oportet ergo omne situatum per se possibile habere situm proprium qui est illam essenciam situari (ut nunc supponitur). Et patet quod secunda pars maioris assumpte sit falsa nec per minorem probata.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶2 · 245.24–246.5

> [p. 245] Et quantum ad miracula (ut secundo narratur de beato Ambrosio), dicitur quod tam quoad tempus quam quoad visum potest esse decepcio. Quoad tempus, quia facile contingit homines errare de ydemptitate instantis; quod patet ex hoc quod nemo scit notare per motum vel sensum primum instans vel medium diei vel temporis; quomodo ergo notarent diversi homines in locis distantibus quod pro eodem instanti corpus beati Ambrosii sit hic et ibi? Et in [p. 246] differencia temporis nobis insensibili posset corpus beati Ambrosii per angelos ab uno loco ad alium deferri et sic interpolari, ut patet de ductu cicionis sic quod apparet in utroque loco ministerium sancti esse continuum.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶3 · 246.6–246.14

> [p. 246] Sed da quod per idem tempus sine interpolacione sit sanctus per illa loca distancia, adhuc non oporteret concedere illud propositum, cum stat sensus illusio propter similitudinem de ydemptificacione corporis; possunt enim spiritui sancti Ambrosii aptari corpora similia et eandem personam secundum illa corpora diversa ministrare simul tempore per diversa loca, ideo illud miraculum supposita eius veritate est nimis nudum ad inferendum propositum.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶4 · 246.15–247.11

> [p. 246] Et quantum ad illud dictum, patet quod non iuvat propositum, cum idem corpus numero potest vicissim esse per diversa loca, sicut idem corpus potest esse per diversa instancia. Unde si applicaretur ad propositum, concederetur quod stat idem corpus esse simul per diversa instancia, sic intenditur quod sit simul per diversa loca, nam tam irracionale et tam inpossibile foret unum sicut reliquum; ideo sicut non potest esse quod idem corpus sit simul per diversa instancia, sic non potest esse quod ipsum sit simul per diversa loca, loquendo de esse dimensionali; faciat ergo sic opinans vel probet quod sint simul tempore diversa eius instancia, et tunc est pro opinione evidencia; sicut enim non possunt simul distendi tempora sic nec loca; loquimur enim de situ inmobili equali linea lineari superficiali vel profundali substancie locate in qua est locus subiective; iste (inquam) sensus de loco est pertinencior quam sensus de concavitate [p. 247] corporis continentis. Et patet quod patencius est nulla instancia posse esse simul tempore quam loca posse esse simul situaliter; immediata (inquam) esse possunt sed simul esse non possunt, quia si A locus sit simul cum B loco sibi equali, tunc ex equali continencia uterque locat reliquum, et sic uterque superfluit componens cum reliquo intensive, et conformiter si multa instancia sunt simul; non enim loquimur de simultate inmediacionis sed de simultate adequacionis, sic quod eadem res de genere loci vel temporis quodlibet sit simul cum alio contineat adequate.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶5 · 247.13–247.28

> [p. 247] Quantum ad tercium dicitur iuxta sanctorum sentencias quod Deus in dictis miraculis fecit materias absconditas ministrari et fecit formas illas paucas et parvas habere virtutem ad assimilandum sibi insensibiliter illas materias, ita quod nulla materialis essencia fit simul et semel per diversa loca; et sic verum est quod ex tanto cibo fecit Christus tantum miraculum saciando tantum populum, tum quia synonymice secundum partem cibi et principative secundum virtutem sibi datam ad assimilandum sibi tantum de huiusmodi alimento quantum Deus voluerit ad finem huiusmodi ministrari; nec sequitur ex isto sensus illusio, Dei ioculacio, miraculi minoracio vel aliud inconveniens nominandum. Et patet in genere solucio illius triplicis textus scripture pro multiplicacione corporis allegate.
