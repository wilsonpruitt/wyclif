# Translation brief: potestate-pape 08-c

You translate these 1 chunk(s) of Wyclif's *Tractatus de potestate pape* in a single pass. Everything you need is in this file:
the working card, the glossary rows these chunks use, and for each chunk its scaffold and the editor's
apparatus for its pages. Work so as to use few tool calls:

1. Read this brief once (it is the only file you need to read, unless the card names one for your chunk).
2. For each chunk, write the COMPLETE chunk file ONCE with the Write tool to its path (given in the chunk's
   header below): the scaffold with `status: translated`, the title, the English after every Latin block,
   headings and side-notes as the card says, Notes, and Transcription notes, in the card's
   layout. Never alter the Latin. Do not make a series of small edits.
3. Use the apparatus given here for variants (the card's rule: a variant that gives the sense is translated
   with a T note citing the siglum; otherwise translate the print and flag it). Open a plate image only if a
   word cannot be construed at all from the print plus the apparatus; otherwise flag it as a Latin doubt.
4. Scripture: quote the Douay-Rheims as you know it. At the END, check every reference you quoted in ONE
   command: `cd /Users/wilsonpruitt/wyclif && .venv/bin/python scripts/w3/bible.py "Ref 1" "Ref 2" ...` and fix any wording
   that differs, in the same chunk file (this is the one allowed round of edits).
5. Run `cd /Users/wilsonpruitt/wyclif && .venv/bin/python scripts/w3/lint.py chunks/potestate-pape/wyc-potestate-pape-08-c.md` once and fix what it reports.
6. Final message: per chunk, the ledger rows (table: id | chunk / note | claim | status | how / next step),
   glossary proposals, Latin doubts, and a one-line note of anything the coordinator must decide.

Standing rules (from the *De ecclesia* briefs, 2026-10-02):
- Do NOT search the Patrologia or other sources; a separate checker verifies them afterwards. Give the
  editor's reference, the modern form in the English, and "to be checked" with a fresh LEDGER id per item
  (never reuse an id).
- Notes open with their bold class codes, `**S/C.**`, never bare letters mid-note. No process words in
  the notes ("the report", "the coordinator", "brief").
- OCR scars (stray English or margin letters, line numbers read as words, glued or broken words,
  numerals read as letters) stay out of the chunk: translate the print's word and list each scar in your
  final message only (page.line, token, likely print reading). The coordinator fixes the Latin.
- Flag every place the established Latin may have LOST a word (it does not construe, especially at a page
  head or foot) or DOUBLED one: page.line and the suspicion. Translate the print as it stands; supply a
  missing word only in brackets with a T note. The editor's print governs; list any departure.


## The working card

# TRANSLATOR CARD — one *De potestate pape* chunk

This card replaces reading CONVENTIONS, the pilot and Thakkar in full: it is their working core.
Adapted from `chunks/ecclesia/CARD.md` (2026-10-07), with its close-out lessons written in. Read it, then `GLOSSARY.md`, then your
scaffold (or your brief, which carries all three). Consult CONVENTIONS.md only when the card sends
you there. Work in `~/wyclif`. Wyclif is approached with **daggers drawn**: the most recent English
versions were "worse than useless" because of four error classes (below). Your English must survive
a hostile reader with the Latin open.

## Work lean (cost is per tool call: each call re-sends your whole context)

1. One call reading what you need (the brief, or CARD + GLOSSARY + scaffold).
2. **One** `bible.py` call with every scripture reference you need (it takes many refs).
3. Plates **only** for a Latin doubt the print plus apparatus cannot settle.
4. Write each finished chunk in **one** Write of the whole file (Latin blocks copied unchanged).
5. Lint once; fix; done. Draft in your head, not in the file.

## The volume

*Tractatus de potestate pape*, ed. Johann Loserth (Wyclif Society, 1907), from the plates of archive.org
`latinworks19wycl` (**leaf = page + 61**). Written 1379 (Loserth), after *De ecclesia* and *De veritate
sacre scripture*, both of which it cites ("libri proximi" at 1.7 is the editor's crux: he takes the
nearest book to be *De officio regis*). A **treatise** in twelve chapters: Wyclif speaks in the first
person, states conclusions, raises objections (*instatur*, *obicitur*, *arguitur*) and answers them.
Its subject is power (*potestas*), what it is and how it is divided, then the papal power: Peter's
primacy, the pope as Christ's vicar, the election of a pope, the "Caesarean" pope and the endowment,
and Antichrist. **Richard FitzRalph** (*dominus Ardmacanus*, "the lord of Armagh"; *Summa in quaestionibus
Armenorum*) is a constant partner, quoted and answered. Pp. 398–406 are a medieval **compendium**
(*Sentencia libri … in compendio*), a summary of the chapters that came down with the work: translate it
like the text.

**Sigla** (Loserth): **A** Prague, Metropolitan Chapter C 73 (his base, "well-preserved", a copy made
"by a man of learning and ability"); **B** Prague, University Library III F 11 (early 15th c.; Loserth
argues A and B are closely related and A cannot have been copied from B); **C** Prague Univ. XI E 3,
variants only near the end (the *Protestationes* extract). Both A and B carry marginal notes, which
Loserth prints ("A in marg.: …", "B in marg.: …"); A's copyist was a Catholic reader who annotates
against Wyclif ("Cave … contradicit sibi"). Cite variants with these sigla.

**The page foot** (in your brief as "apparatus", by page) has two blocks, both keyed to the line:
the variants (`27, 28. B: et aliqua potencia est creata deest.`) and Loserth's source references (`27. Decret. Unam sanctam.
Extrav. comm. lib. I, tit. VIII, cap. I.`). The OCR of it is rough: read it for sense, not letter by letter.

## The job

The Latin in your scaffold is **established and frozen** (three-witness vote + plate reading). Fill
`[TITLE]` (short, lower case: "headship: the pope is not head of the church"), each `[ENGLISH]`, the
notes and the transcription notes; set `status: translated`; lint; report.

- **Headings:** keep `## ¶k · range` exactly. **Never change a range; never split a paragraph.**
  (The pilot headed its paragraphs with Loserth's alinea letters A, B, C; the scaffolds do not
  carry them, so leave the ¶ numbers.)
- **Never alter the Latin.** OCR scars you find (a stray mark, an English side-note word, a broken word) are
  REPORTED, never repaired in your file: the coordinator repairs the established text (`text/potestate-pape/
  tokenfix.tsv`) and refreshes the chunk's Latin. A Latin block you receive may already carry such repairs. A word that looks wrong: read the apparatus for that line first; then,
  if still doubtful, the plate (`text/potestate-pape/raw/leaves/nLEAF.jpg`, LEAF = page + 61 padded to four digits: p. 1 = `n0062.jpg`;
  ⚠ **p. 266** is faded blank in that scan: use `https://archive.org/download/tractatusdepotes00wycl/page/n327.jpg`). A variant
  that gives the sense → translate it + **T** note citing the siglum; a compelling emendation →
  translate it + **T** note "(our emendation)"; neither → translate the print and flag it. Never
  smooth nonsense into sense. Report every such case. **Loserth's printed text governs** (ruled
  2026-10-02): translate it, his own emendations included, unless it will not construe; a manuscript
  reading is chosen only then, and a single manuscript's reading never outweighs the print without cause; every departure gets a T note
  giving both readings. Open flags for this volume:
  `text/potestate-pape/PLATE-FLAGS.md` (read it if it exists and your pages are listed there).
- **English layout:** `[N]` at the same word as `[p. N]` in the Latin (the chunk's first `[p. N]` is
  implicit). Supplied words in `[brackets]`, sparingly. **Quotations** in quotation marks. Your brief
  carries Loserth's **italic runs** per page (from the scan's OCR; a side-note can split one run in two,
  and an apparatus phrase occasionally slips in). They are the editor's judgement of where a quotation
  runs, not the manuscript's: follow them by default, depart where the source shows otherwise (say so in
  a note). Reviews do not check quotation bounds against the italics. Italicised scripture inside
  indirect speech is quoted too (the italic words in quotation marks, the English syntax around them); where
  quoting would garble the sentence, leave it unquoted and give the reference in an **S** note.
- **Ordinals:** a degree-sign ordinal can print or OCR like a two-digit number (*30 et 10* = 3° and 1°, *Pot.
  pape* 3.28). Read both forms the same way, and check the plate when a citation looks impossible.
- **Formulae of the disputation** (GLOSSARY §C, ruled 2026-10-01), rendered the same way throughout: *instatur* "it is objected" ·
  *obicitur* "it is objected" · *arguitur* "it is argued" (with *per*: GLOSSARY) · *dicitur* "it is
  said" (in an answer: "the answer is") · *respondetur* "the reply is" · *conclusio* "conclusion" ·
  *antecedens / consequens* "antecedent / consequent" · *consequencia* "inference", ⛔ never
  "consequence" (GLOSSARY §C).

## The four error classes (Thakkar) — check every sentence

1. **Terms:** GLOSSARY.md governs, one term one rendering. Tag the **first occurrence in the chunk**
   of every §A–C term: `[quiddity]{g:quiditas}`. The key must exist in GLOSSARY.md. A term that looks
   technical but has no row: render it sensibly, untagged, and propose it in your report.
   **CONTEXTUAL** rows hold two senses English splits: choose by context and write a **C** note at
   the first occurrence in the chunk and wherever it leans to the other sense (the dikaiosune rule,
   CONVENTIONS §6).
   Key rulings carried from *De ecclesia*: *ecclesia* church (**lower-case**) · *caput* head ·
   *membrum* member · *predestinati* the predestinate · *presciti* the foreknown · *papa* pope ·
   *vicarius Christi* vicar of Christ · *caritas* charity (never love) · *dominium* lordship · *viator*
   wayfarer · *ex fide* as faith teaches · *sentencia* teaching (the rest: GLOSSARY).
   ⚠ **This volume's own term is *potestas*** and its kin (*potencia*, *auctoritas*, *iurisdiccio*,
   *primatus*, *dotacio*, *papa cesareus*): check GLOSSARY for each; where it has no row, render
   consistently within your brief and PROPOSE the row (the coordinator rules between briefs).
   **Ruled (Wilson, 2026-10-07):** *potestas* is always "power". *potencia* is CONTEXTUAL: "potency" inside
   Aristotle's analysis of *dynamis* (active / passive potency, rational potency, the potency terminated),
   "power" elsewhere (God's power, free choice, ordinary might); *potencia absoluta* stays "absolute power".
   Wyclif uses the two words interchangeably (*potestas vel potencia* 4.7, *potestatem sive potenciam* 4.11):
   render such a pair "power or potency" and write a **C** note at the first one in your chunk. Never write a
   note or headnote that claims the two words differ in sense; ch. 1 shows they do not.
2. **Connectives carry the argument.** ⛔ Never omit one, never turn one into filler.

   | Latin | English | Never |
   |---|---|---|
   | enim, nam | for | "now", "indeed" |
   | ergo, igitur, ideo | therefore, so, then | "now", "and", "indeed" |
   | sed / autem, marking the **minor premiss or next step** | now | (omitted) |
   | sed / autem, adversative | but | (omitted) |
   | autem, continuative | and | (omitted), and **not "now"** |
   | cum (concessive / causal) | although / since | "whenever" |
   | tamen | yet, nevertheless | "therefore" |
   | item | again, also | "now" |
   | vero (continuative) | and; but (adversative) | "now", "truly" |
   | verumtamen | nevertheless | "but truly" |
   | unde | hence, so | "whence" (archaic), "where" |
   | per idem | by the same token | "in the same way" |
   | ymmo | indeed, rather (correcting upward) | (omitted) |
   | patet; constat | it is clear; it is evident | |

   *nunc … aliquando* ("at one time … at another") is never "now". "Now" is reserved for the minor premiss, or the step that brings a new premiss to bear (*Illos
   autem parentes debemus …*, 1.17). An *autem* that only extends the same step is "and" (*Illis autem
   cultis …*, 1.19). ⚠ The commonest error in *De ecclesia* (close-out, ~50 of 69 connective fixes): a
   *sed* that brings the minor premiss of a syllogism closed by *ergo / ideo / igitur* rendered "but".
   Before writing "but" for a *sed*, look ahead for the *ergo*: if one follows, it is "now".
3. **Ordinary words with a medieval sense:** GLOSSARY §D; look up any word whose classical and
   Wyclifite senses may differ, and propose additions.
4. **Syntax:** construe before rendering (main verb, subject, what every relative and genitive
   hangs on). Keep quantifier order where it is meaning (*nullus papa … caput*; *quilibet papa*).
   Keep Wyclif's long periods where English tolerates them. **A doubtful construal is never chosen
   silently:** translate the likelier reading and write a **C** note giving the alternative.

## Scripture

`python3 scripts/w3/bible.py "Luc 17:23"` (Vulgate + Douay–Rheims; psalms in Vulgate numbering) or
`python3 scripts/w3/bible.py --find "nolite ire neque sectemini"`. Where Wyclif's Latin agrees with the
Clementine Vulgate, use the **Douay–Rheims wording**. Where he departs, translate *his* Latin and write
an **S** note giving the Vulgate. Modern references in the English (Luke 17:23). The chapter numbers
are Wyclif's, the verse numbers Loserth's (the headnote says so once).

## Already glossed in this work (no second first-occurrence note)

*prescitus* "the foreknown" (03-a) · *satrapa* (04-e) · *curatus* (02-d) · *potencia* CONTEXTUAL (01-a) · *dominus Ardmacanus* / *Armachanus* (01-a, 02-c) · *Lincolniensis* "Lincoln" (03-e). Gloss a term again only where its sense here differs.

## Notes

- `[^n]` from 1, the marker placed in the same edit as its note, each opening with a type letter:
  **T** text · **C** construal · **G** glossary (passage-specific only; otherwise a tag) · **S** source ·
  **R** reception/context (e.g. a B marginal gloss that shows how an early reader construed the text,
  CONVENTIONS §4; Hus's reuse where Loserth notes it, e.g. "Hus, fol. 21b" in the apparatus).
- **Density: about one note per 70–100 Latin words**, fewer where the text is plain. Short, factual,
  says what the Latin does and stops. No modern theology, no evaluation.
- **Every identification** other than scripture checked with bible.py gets a ledger row in your
  report with a status: `editor` (Loserth's source reference at the page foot), `to-verify` (from
  memory: every patristic or canon-law identification you did not read in this session), `verified`
  (you read the source text this session: say where; local PL at `~/patrologia/sources/pl/tei/`).
  ⛔ Never pass memory off as verified. Id `P<chunk>-<n>` (`P02a-1`), cited in the note:
  "(LEDGER P02a-1)". FitzRalph: cite book and chapter of the *Summa in quaestionibus Armenorum* as
  Loserth gives them (he often says "mihi ad manum non est", i.e. he could not check: then `to-verify`). Loserth's references to the *Corpus iuris canonici* (Decretum, Extravagantes)
  are `editor`; give them in modern form (*Extrav. comm.* 1.8.1) and say the form is ours.

## Model of register

`pilots/wyc-ecclesia-01a.md` (De ecclesia pp. 1–5) is a reviewed model of register and note style:
read it for that only (it predates some GLOSSARY rulings; **GLOSSARY governs**). **Chunk 01-a** carries
the `## Headnote` (CONVENTIONS §12 order: occasion, text, the work's move, where it is answered; date, editor,
sigla, the compendium), each unverified claim marked `[verify]`.

## Side-notes

Already read against the plates (WORKFLOW 5, `text/potestate-pape/sidenotes.fixed.tsv`) and
placed in your scaffold's section. ⛔ Do not edit them. One that is plainly wrong (garbled, or at
the wrong line): report it under Latin doubts as `side-note page.line`.

## Finish

1. `status: translated` in the front matter (nothing else changes there).
2. `.venv/bin/python scripts/w3/lint.py chunks/potestate-pape/<your chunk>.md` until clean.
3. The four-class check above, sentence by sentence.
4. ⛔ Edit **only your chunk(s)**. No git, no other files. Everything shared goes in your report.

## Report (≤ 200 words per chunk, exactly these heads)

- **Chunk:** id, Latin words, notes.
- **Ledger rows:** in LEDGER.md's table format `| id | chunk / note | claim | status | how / next step |`.
- **Glossary proposals:** Latin · proposed English · where · why.
- **Latin doubts:** page.line · printed · suspicion · settled on the plate?

## Glossary (the 112 rows these chunks use; the full file is GLOSSARY.md)

# GLOSSARY — FROZEN 2026-09-28 (Wilson's pilot review)

*One Latin term, one English rendering, every time, across the whole corpus. A reader must be able
to recognise the same word coming back, because Wyclif's arguments turn on it. A rendering changes
only by a dated decision in CONVENTIONS' decision log, never silently in a chunk. Entries may be
*added* by recorded decision as new terms appear. **Tag keys:** a chunk tags a term as
`[English]{g:latin-form}` (CONVENTIONS §11), and the key must match a Latin form in one of the rows
below. These rows are also the source of the site's hover glossary. Where a term has two senses,
the entry says so and each chunk's note picks one. A term marked **CONTEXTUAL** holds together
senses English splits: its English is chosen by context, under the dikaiosune rule (CONVENTIONS §6).*

**Sources of the decisions.** "Pilot" = settled in `pilots/` this session. "T. p. N" = Mark
Thakkar, "Duces caecorum," *Vivarium* 58 (2020), page N (`reference/`), which documents the
errors of the two most recent translations. His corrections are adopted here unless an entry says
otherwise.

**Orthography.** Headwords are given in the Society editions' medieval spelling (*eciam*,
*racio*, *quiditas*, *ymmo*), because that is what the translator will meet on the page.

---

## A. The church

| Latin | English | Note |
|---|---|---|
| ecclesia | church | Lower-case in English except in a proper title. |
| ecclesia militans / triumphans / dormiens | the church militant / triumphant / sleeping | *Dormiens* = the souls in purgatory. Not "dormant". |
| predestinatus, -i | the predestinate (sg. "a predestinate [person]") | Never "the elect", which is *electi* and gets "the elect". |
| prescitus, -i | **the foreknown** | ⭐ Wyclif's technical term for those God foreknows will be damned. It is **not** "the reprobate" (*reprobi* → "the reprobate"). Explain it in a note at its first occurrence in **each work**. The English word misleads on its own and Penn explains it only once (T. p. 361 n. 12). Pilot. |
| via / patria | the way / the homeland | *Beatitudo patrie* → "the blessedness of the homeland". Pilot. The earthly sense (one's native country) is also "homeland"; a note where it matters (*Dial.* 54.2). |
| Christicole | worshippers of Christ | Ruled 2026-09-28. |
| litere fraternitatum | letters of fraternity | Friars' letters admitting a benefactor to the order's suffrages. Ruled 2026-09-28 (4 sites). |
| capitaneus | captain | Kept apart from *caput* "head": Wyclif grants the pope captaincy and denies him headship. Ruled 2026-10-01 (*Eccl.* 17.13, 19.21–24, 22.8). |
| obedienciarius | one who obeys | Non-classical agent noun: the subject bound to obey (not the monastic officer). Ruled 2026-10-02 (*Eccl.* 39.3). |
| ecclesiastici | CONTEXTUAL: clergy / those who belong to the church | Usually the clergy; where Wyclif means every member of the church (*Eccl.* 81.4) render "those who belong to the church" and write a **C** note. Ruled 2026-10-02. |
| ecclesia laycalis / secularis | the lay church / the secular church | Ruled 2026-10-02 (154.15, 156.3). |
| vicarius Christi | vicar of Christ | The card's ruling, now a row. Ruled 2026-10-02. |

## B. Lordship, law, office

| Latin | English | Note |
|---|---|---|
| dominium | **lordship** | Not "dominion". Titles: *De civili dominio* → *On Civil Lordship*; *De dominio divino* → *On Divine Lordship*. |
| dominus; dominari | lord; to exercise lordship / to lord it | Pick by context (neutral vs. pejorative) and note the pejorative. |
| dominium civile / naturale / evangelicum | civil / natural / evangelical lordship | |
| dominacio | exercise of lordship | Kept apart from *dominium*. Ruled 2026-09-28 (6 sites). |
| ordinacio; ordinancia | ordinance; of the sacrament, ordination | Two senses by referent (not CONTEXTUAL): the sacrament (*clericorum ordinacio*, *Dial.* 50.21) is "ordination"; everywhere else "ordinance". Ruled 2026-09-28 (22 sites). |
| capitalis dominus; tenere de | chief lord; to hold of | Feudal tenure language, kept literal: the lords "hold of Christ as chief lord". Pilot (Dialogus 2.19). |
| servicium | service | Pair with *dominium* (T. p. 363 n. 19 on the definitions). Liturgical *servicia ecclesie*, "services of the church", is untagged. Ruled 2026-09-29 (coordinator, delegated, close-out). |
| ius | right / law | ⚠ Two senses (subjective right vs. body of law). The chunk's note picks one wherever it matters. |
| vicarius deitatis / vicarius humanitatis Christi | vicar of the Godhead / vicar of Christ's humanity | King and priest respectively (*Dial.* 2.14–16; *Off. reg.* 13, 137). Pilot. |
| deitas / divinitas | the Godhead / divinity | Kept distinct; B reads *divinitatis* at *Dial.* 2.13. |
| manus mortua | the dead hand | Mortmain; kept literal because Truth's pun turns on it (*Dial.* 60.18, 61.14–17). Ruled 2026-09-28 (coordinator, delegated) (3 sites). |
| appropriare; appropriacio | to appropriate; appropriation | Canon law: a parish church annexed to a college or house. Ruled 2026-09-28 (coordinator, delegated) (4 sites). |
| tercia pars ecclesie | the third part of the church | The commons (*Dial.* 85.15, 85.22). Ruled 2026-09-28 (coordinator, delegated). |
| ius patronatus | right of patronage | Ruled 2026-09-28 (coordinator, delegated). |
| papa | pope | Ruled 2026-09-28 (34 sites). |
| episcopus; dominus episcopus | bishop; the lord bishop | *Dominis episcopis* → "the lord bishops". The courtesy is his, possibly barbed; don't sharpen it. Pilot. |
| religio privata; secta | private religion; sect | His name for the religious orders. Keep "sect". |
| religiosi | the religious | Members of the orders. Ruled 2026-09-28 (8 sites). |
| de virtute sermonis | in the proper sense of the words | Wyclif's recurring formula for the literal force of an expression. Ruled 2026-10-02 (*Eccl.* 115.6, 115.8). |
| ficticia | fiction | A feigned ground in an objection (*Nec valet ficticia*). Ruled 2026-10-02 (145.19). |
| gracia preveniens / comitans / concomitans / consumans | prevenient / accompanying / concomitant / consummating grace | Ruled 2026-10-02 (06-g). |
| contribules | countrymen | Lev. 25:17 (DR). Ruled 2026-10-02 (208.2, 214.20, 214.27). |
| autenticus / autenticacio | authentic / authentication | The key term of *Eccl.* 13. Ruled 2026-10-02. |

## C. Logic, disputation, metaphysics

| Latin | English | Note |
|---|---|---|
| sentenciare | to pronounce | The verb of *sentencia*. Ruled 2026-09-28 (2 sites). |
| sequela | CONTEXTUAL: what follows / following | The logical consequence "what follows"; of following Christ (*sequela Christi*) "following" (*Pot. pape* 63.13). Ruled 2026-09-28; second sense 2026-10-07. |
| racio (against *substancia*) | aspect | This technical sense only; *racio* elsewhere by context. Ruled 2026-09-28 (coordinator, delegated). |
| differencia | difference (logical *differentia*) | Pilot (*Eccl.* 1.10). |
| subiectum / passio | subject / attribute | *Passio* in the *Posterior Analytics* sense (a proper attribute), never "passion". Pilot. |
| dicitur multipliciter | is said in many ways | Aristotle's *pollachōs legetai*. Pilot. |
| necessitas supposicionis / ex supposicione | necessity of supposition / necessity on supposition | Conditional necessity. Pilot (*Eccl.* 3.21); *ex supposicione* ruled 2026-10-02 (34.12, 38.22). |
| de congruo / de condigno | by congruity / by condignity | Pilot. |
| sequitur | it follows | Introduces a stated inference, often quoted in the next words. Pilot (*Eccl.* 2.21). Not tagged where it is not an inference ("the third law follows", *Dial.* ch. 5). Ruled 2026-09-29 (coordinator, delegated, close-out). |
| claudit contradictionem / contradictorium | it implies a contradiction | Stronger than "is against reason". Keep the escalation visible. Pilot (*Eccl.* 5.4). |
| dicitur (opening an answer) | the answer is | Elsewhere "it is said" (*Hic dicitur quod …*, *Eccl.* 26.8: "To this the answer is that …"). Ruled 2026-10-01 (Wilson). |
| successivum / permanens | successive entity / permanent entity | T. p. 368 n. 31. |
| ens / esse / essencia | a being / being (existence) / essence | ⚠ *Esse* is ambiguous; note when it matters. |
| ex fide | as faith teaches; with a genitive, from the faith of [scripture] | "It is of faith", on scripture's authority. *Ex fide scripture / duplicis testamenti* → "from the faith of scripture / of the twofold testament". Ruled 2026-09-28 after a census (30 sites in the *Dialogus*). An adjective works like the genitive: *ex fide catholica* → "from the catholic faith". Not the formula when a verb or participle governs *ex* (*racio capta ex fide* → "reason drawn from faith", epil-a). Ruled 2026-09-29 (coordinator, delegated, close-out). |
| sentencia | CONTEXTUAL: teaching / sentence | The position taught, incl. Falsehood's (*tua sentencia*, "your teaching"). Not "sentence" for a position taught.

# *De potestate pape*, chapter 8, part 3: [TITLE]

## ¶1 · 173.33–174.11

> [p. 173] Item, quicumque superstes dat alteri potestatem solum dat sibi potestatem vicariam et non parem, [p. 174] igitur ex hoc quod Petrus instituit Clementem Rome pontificem, non sequitur successorem suum fuisse summum pontificem sicut Petrus. Nec valet ficticia, qua dicitur quod Petrus Rome obiit, ideo successor suus ibidem debuit esse papa. Nam Christus papa summus obiit Jerusolimis et tamen Jacobus Alphei tenens ibidem episcopatum a Christo datum et ibi obiens non propterea fuit papa. Que igitur liga Petri ad Clementem pocius quam Christus ad Jacobum, ut episcopus succedens loco quo obiit foret papa?

[ENGLISH]

## ¶2 · 174.12–176.4

> [p. 174] Item, non subiacet humane potestati sed solum divine constituere quemquam summum pontificem, igitur non debet supponi in Petro tanta presumpcio, ut eligat hominem de quo non fuit sibi ad hoc facta revelacio in summum pontificem et immediatum Christi vicarium super terram, specialiter cum super ista fatuitate, non relinquitur nobis scriptum autenticum, sed in eleccione Mathie reliquit hoc divine iudicio, ut patet Actuum primo; quanto plus in eleccione maioris. Quis, inquam, crederet quod Petrus diffiniret beatum Clementem sequi Christum similius quam Evangelistam, qui diu vixit post Petrum, vel beatum Evangelistam debere Clementi ut maiori? vel capiti necessario regulandi obedienciam et reverenciam, qualem pape iam exigunt a subiectis. vel quod Christus aut alius apostolus talem maioritatem instituit, vel policiam in sua ecclesia approbavit? Voluit enim omnes apostolos esse socios sibi invicem obedientes et servientes sine dominio vel magisterio alicuius capitanei preter Christum. Et ex istis infirmatur tercia ficticia quod per viam eleccionis et institucionis humane ponitur [p. 175] quis Romanus et summus pontifex. Et quamvis ista sentencia sit maxime propinqua facto, tamen nimis elongatur a religione fideli et stabili fundamento. Cum enim aliquem stat esse Romanum pontificem et non papam et econtra, ut patet in Christo et Petro, patet quod oportet istas duas elecciones esse racionis disparis et nature ordine separatas. Stat enim aliquem esse Romanum pontificem et pessimum Antichristum, sicut econtra stat aliquem esse summum pontificem, cum hoc quod sit loco illi indifferens, ut patet ex dictis. Unde dominus Ardmacanus libro VII, cap. XVIII De Questionibus Armenorum dicit quod sunt duo pontificatus naturaliter differentes, et oportet quod sint eciam apud Deum due elecciones. Sed videtur michi quod eleccio qua quis eligeretur in papam vel summum pontificem non subiacet potestati vel eleccioni humane. Nam idem est hominem eligere in papam vel summum pontificem et eligere ipsum in apostolicum maxime propinque per graciam sequentem Christi vestigia; sed hoc non subiacet ordinacioni vel eleccioni humane, igitur nec aliud sive idem; sic enim eligeret quis hominem in predestinatum vel quocumque aliter graciosum. Et confirmatur ex factis et verbis apostolorum Act. I in eleccione Mathie apostoli, quod est minus quam eligere summum pontificem, ubi ipsi non eligunt sed rogant Deum; ut ostendat ipse quem elegerit. Sicut igitur electores non eligunt summum pontificem in eligendo alterum Scarioth vel Antichristum; sic casualiter eligendo eum quem Deus elegerit non [p. 176] eligunt talem in summum pontificem, sed in fungentem tali officio, quod non dicit excellenciam gracie vel alia carismata, que sunt propria dona Dei.

## Loserth's side-notes (PD, verbatim; not our translation)

- 174.2: Nor does Clement's succession to the bishopric carry the papacy.
- 174.8: Why Clement rather than James?
- 174.12: Peter would not presume to choose Christ's vicar without a revelation,
- 174.24: Was John the Evangelist subject to Clement?
- 174.33: That the pope is such
- 175.1: by human election is true to fact but lacks religious sanction.
- 175.15: Man cannot choose a pope truly,
- 175.21: since it depends on grace which man cannot judge.
