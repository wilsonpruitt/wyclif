# TRANSLATOR CARD — one *De eucharistia* chunk

This card replaces reading CONVENTIONS, the pilot and Thakkar in full: it is their working core.
Adapted from `chunks/potestate-pape/CARD.md` (Loserth's other volume) with the B+ lessons of
`chunks/incarnacione/CARD.md` (2026-11-06; **reviewed 2026-11-06** on `prol-a`: `_review/REVIEW-prol-a.md`). Read it, then `GLOSSARY.md`,
then your scaffold (or your brief, which carries all three). Consult CONVENTIONS.md only when the card sends
you there. Work in `~/wyclif`. Wyclif is approached with **daggers drawn**: the most recent English
versions were "worse than useless" because of four error classes (below). Your English must survive
a hostile reader with the Latin open.

## Work lean (cost is per tool call: each call re-sends your whole context)

1. One call reading what you need (the brief, or CARD + GLOSSARY + scaffold).
2. **One** `bible.py` call with every scripture reference you need (it takes many refs).
3. Plates **only** for a Latin doubt the print plus apparatus cannot settle.
4. Write each finished chunk in **one** Write of the whole file (Latin blocks copied unchanged).
5. Lint once; fix; done. Draft in your head, not in the file.

## The volume

*Tractatus de eucharistia* and *Tractatus de penitencia sive de confessione*, ed. Johann Loserth (Wyclif
Society, 1892), from the plates of archive.org `latinworks13wycl` (**leaf = page + 71**; leaf images in
`text/eucharistia/raw/leaves/`). Three texts:

Chunk ids: `prol-a … prol-c` the compendium, `01-a … 09-n` the nine chapters, `pen01 … pen06` *De
penitencia*, `quest` the *Questio*.

- **pp. 1–10, the compendium** (*Sentencia tractatus de Eukaristia in compendio*, under "Prologus"): a
  medieval summary of the nine chapters that came down with the work. Translate it like the text.
- **pp. 11–326, the *Tractatus de eucharistia* (maior)**, nine long chapters. Written in Wyclif's last
  years, before 1382–83 (Loserth, Introd. §4: it shares passages word for word with *Sermones* III, and
  it avoids the words *substancia* and *materialis* of the bread, which Wyclif says in *Sermo* III.54 he
  has stopped using). Wyclif's case against the "modern" doctrine: that the consecrated host is in its
  nature bread and wine and sacramentally, figuratively, the body and blood of Christ; that an accident
  without a subject is impossible; that the decree *Ego Berengarius* (*De cons.* D. 2 c. 42) is the
  faith of the ancient Roman church; against the friars, Thomas, Scotus and "the sect of the signs".
  A **treatise**: Wyclif speaks in the first person, states conclusions, raises objections and answers
  them. The tractatus minor (the *Confessio*) is NOT in this volume (Shirley, *Fasc. Ziz.*).
- **pp. 327–348, *De eucharistia et penitencia sive de confessione*** in six chapters (only ch. 1 is on
  the eucharist; the rest is penance and auricular confession), then the short ***Questio ad fratres de
  sacramento altaris*** (pp. 347–348, its first part only: Loserth notes that the rest of the
  manuscript's text is not on the sacrament, and is Hus's).

**Sigla. ⚠ They differ between the two works.** *De eucharistia* (Introd. §5): **A** Vienna 3927;
**B** Vienna 3932; **C** Vienna 1387 ("the best of the three" Vienna MSS, correcting A and B); **D** Prague
Univ. IV D 22 (1404–05, Andreas of Kouřim); **E** Prague Univ. XI E 3 (1460; Loserth: "the best and most
reliable text of all the five"). Loserth's lettering "does not in any way refer to their respective
value". The Vienna MSS are one group, the Prague MSS another. *De penitencia* (Introd. §6): **A** Vienna
3927; **B** Bautzen, Gersdorf Library M. St. 80.7; **C** Vienna 1337; **D** Prague Univ. III G 11; **E**
Vienna 3980; **F** Vienna 4527. Cite variants with the sigla of the work you are in. Marginal notes in the
manuscripts that Loserth prints ("F in marg.", "DB in marg.") are reception: an **R** note where they
show how a reader took the text.

**The page foot** (in your brief as "apparatus", by page) has two blocks, both keyed to the **line**:
the variants (`19. C: ecclesie in marg. alia manu.`) and Loserth's source references. The OCR of it is
rough: read it for sense, not letter by letter, and read the plate foot where a variant matters.

## The job

The Latin in your scaffold is **established and frozen** (blind transcription of the plates, checked word
by word against a four-scan vote; residue read on the plate). Fill `[TITLE]` (short, lower case: "the
three opinions on the quiddity of the host"), each `[ENGLISH]`, the notes and the transcription notes;
set `status: translated`; lint; report.

- **Headings:** keep `## ¶k · range` exactly. **Never change a range; never split a paragraph.**
- **Never alter the Latin.** A transcription error you find (a stray mark, a broken word, a side-note
  word in the text) is REPORTED, never repaired in your file: the coordinator repairs the transcription
  (`text/eucharistia/bt/pNNN.txt`) and refreshes the chunk's Latin. A word that looks wrong: read the
  apparatus for that line first; then, if still doubtful, the plate (`text/eucharistia/raw/leaves/nLEAF.jpg`,
  LEAF = page + 71 padded to four digits: p. 1 = `n0072.jpg`). A variant that gives the sense → translate
  it + **T** note citing the siglum; a compelling emendation → translate it + **T** note "(our
  emendation)"; neither → translate the print and flag it. Never smooth nonsense into sense. Report every
  such case. **Loserth's printed text governs** (ruled 2026-10-02 for Loserth's volumes; the
  manuscripts-outrank-the-print rule is Harris's volumes only): translate it, his own emendations
  included, unless it will not construe; a manuscript reading is chosen only then, or where the source
  Wyclif quotes, read this session, agrees with it. Every departure gets a T note giving both readings.
- **The compendia (`prol-a … prol-c`) summarise chapters whose Latin is already established** in this
  directory. Where the compendium's ellipsis leaves a construal open (whose argument, which *per* phrase is a
  ground and which a means), grep the chapter's `>` blocks, follow them, and cite the page in the **C** note:
  that is construal, not source verification, and one call. (`prol-a` 2.1–5: the three decrees are the
  objections' grounds, ch. 1 pp. 24, 25, 28.)
- **English layout:** `[N]` at the same word as `[p. N]` in the Latin (the chunk's first `[p. N]` is
  implicit). Supplied words in `[brackets]`, sparingly, ⛔ never in italics. **Quotations** (a quotation running on across ¶s or into the next chunk opens each ¶ with a double quote and closes only at its end; quotations inside it take single quotes) in quotation
  marks. Your brief carries Loserth's **italic runs** per page where the scan's OCR gives them (rough;
  ⚠ page numbers drift: a run not in your page's Latin belongs to a neighbouring page): they are
  the editor's judgement of where a quotation runs, not the manuscript's: follow them by default, depart
  where the source shows otherwise (say so in a note). Reviews do not check quotation bounds against the
  italics. Italicised scripture inside indirect speech is quoted too; where quoting would garble the
  sentence, leave it unquoted and give the reference in an **S** note.
- **Ordinals:** a degree-sign ordinal can print or OCR like a two-digit number (*30 et 10* = 3° and 1°).
  Read both forms the same way, and check the plate when a citation looks impossible.
- **Formulae of the disputation** (ruled 2026-10-01; fixed renderings, tagged only where GLOSSARY has a
  row): *instatur* "it is objected" · *obicitur* "it is objected" · *arguitur* "it is argued" (with
  *per*: GLOSSARY) · *dicitur* "it is said" (in an answer: "the answer is") · *respondetur* "the reply is"
  · *conclusio* "conclusion" · *antecedens / consequens* "antecedent / consequent" · *consequencia*
  "inference", ⛔ never "consequence" · *patet* "it is clear" · *supponitur* "it is supposed" ·
  *probatur* "proof:" or "it is proved" · *confirmatur* "this is confirmed" · *solvit / dissolvit* (an objection) "resolves", both (never "answers", which belongs to *respondetur / dicitur*).
- **A source note says only what the Latin says about the source** (who narrates, which book, which work)
  and leaves the rest to the ledger: never supply a story the Latin rules out (*narratum a beato Gregorio*:
  Gregory narrates).
- **Citation formulae:** *ubi supra* "in the place cited above" (⛔ never a claim about where a passage
  stands), *ut supra* "as above", *infra* "below". *Utrobique* "on both sides / in both places".

## The four error classes (Thakkar) — check every sentence

1. **Terms:** GLOSSARY.md governs, one term one rendering. Tag the **first occurrence in the chunk** of
   every §A–C term: `[accident]{g:accidens}`; a multi-word key is lower case with hyphens, `{g:corpus-christi}`, `{g:a-simili}` (lint rejects spaces); never nest brackets inside a tag (`[form [sounds] with]{g:k}` breaks the site): tag the bare word. The key must exist in GLOSSARY.md. A term that looks
   technical but has no row: render it sensibly, untagged, and propose it in your report.
   **CONTEXTUAL** rows hold two senses English splits: choose by context and write a **C** note at the
   first occurrence in the chunk and wherever it leans to the other sense (the dikaiosune rule,
   CONVENTIONS §6).
   Rows that already exist and bear on this volume: *accidens* "accident" · *accidens absolutum*
   "absolute accident" · *transsubstanciacio* "transubstantiation" · *conficere* "consecrate (the
   eucharist)" · *figura / figuratum* "figure / thing figured" · *res sacramenti* "reality of the
   sacrament" · *sacramentalia* "sacramentals" · *quantus* "quantified" · *per se / per accidens* "of
   itself / by accident" · *sensibile commune* "common sensible" · *ecclesia* church (**lower-case**) ·
   *caritas* charity · *sentencia* teaching (and *sentencia verborum* "sense", a separate row) · *ex fide* as faith teaches ·
   *opinio* opinion · *novelli* the newer [doctors] · *sancti* the saints · *concludere* infer ("conclude" only where a
   conclusion is literally drawn) · *deduccio* deduction · *maneries* kind · *principaliter* as a main head ·
   *sensibilis* perceptible · *declarare / ostendere* make clear / show · *ecclesia* is tagged at its first
   occurrence in every chunk.
   **This volume's vocabulary is now ruled (2026-11-06, `prol-a` review):** *sacramentum* (the eucharist) ·
   *hostia* host · *panis / vinum* bread / wine · *calix* chalice · *corpus Christi / Domini* kept apart ·
   *remanencia* the remaining · *accidens sine subiecto* · *substancia · quantitas · qualitas* · *esse /
   esse sacramentale* being / sacramental being · *esus / manducacio* eating · *confeccio* consecration ·
   *secta signorum* · *novella / antiqua ecclesia* · *predicacio ydemptica / tropica* identical / tropical
   predication. **The mode adverbs, one word each, never merged, each tagged at first occurrence:**
   *sacramentaliter* sacramentally · *realiter* really (never "actually") · *vere* truly (never "really") ·
   *spiritualiter* spiritually · *virtualiter* virtually · *figurative* figuratively · *tropice* tropically ·
   *ydemptice* identically · *invisibiliter* invisibly · *sensibiliter* perceptibly · *corporaliter* bodily ·
   *substancialiter* substantially · *dimensionaliter* dimensionally. A term still missing a row (*ydemptificacio*,
   *conversio*, *fractio*, *confessio auricularis*, *absolucio*, *claves* …): render it sensibly, untagged, and
   propose it. *Ego Berengarius* stays as the decree's title (Wyclif's spelling *Beringarius* in the Latin;
   "Berengar" for the man in the English). In ch. 1, *res sacramenti* "reality of the sacrament" is a ruled
   row: the compendium's *de rebus huius sacramenti* (1.3) is the three-membered distinction the chapter sets
   out, so keep its *res* consistent with that row.
2. **Connectives carry the argument.** ⛔ Never omit one, never turn one into filler.

   | Latin | English | Never |
   |---|---|---|
   | enim, nam | for | "now", "indeed" |
   | ergo, igitur, ideo | therefore, so, then | "now", "and", "indeed" |
   | sed / autem, marking the **minor premiss or next step** | now | (omitted) |
   | sed / autem, adversative | but | (omitted) |
   | autem, continuative | and | (omitted), and **not "now"** |
   | cum (concessive / causal) | although / since | "whenever" |
   | tamen | yet, nevertheless | "therefore" |
   | item | again, also | "now" |
   | vero (continuative) | and; but (adversative) | "now", "truly" |
   | verumtamen | nevertheless | "but truly" |
   | unde | hence, so | "whence" (archaic), "where" |
   | per idem | by the same token | "in the same way" |
   | ymmo | indeed, rather (correcting upward) | (omitted) |
   | patet; constat | it is clear; it is evident | |

   "Now" is reserved for the minor premiss, or the step that brings a new premiss to bear. An *autem*
   that only extends the same step is "and". ⚠ The commonest error in *De ecclesia* (close-out, ~50 of
   69 connective fixes): a *sed* that brings the minor premiss of a syllogism closed by *ergo / ideo /
   igitur* rendered "but". Before writing "but" for a *sed*, look ahead for the *ergo*: if one follows,
   it is "now".
3. **Ordinary words with a medieval sense:** GLOSSARY §D; look up any word whose classical and
   Wyclifite senses may differ, and propose additions.
4. **Syntax:** construe before rendering (main verb, subject, what every relative and genitive hangs
   on). Keep quantifier order where it is meaning. Keep Wyclif's long periods where English tolerates
   them. **A doubtful construal is never chosen silently:** translate the likelier reading and write a
   **C** note giving the alternative.
   ⚠ **Predication is the matter here, as in *De incarnacione*.** *Hoc est corpus meum*, *panis est
   corpus Christi*, *hoc sacramentum est panis*: Wyclif argues about what the pronoun demonstrates and
   in what mode the predicate holds. Keep subject and predicate in his order, keep *est* as "is" (never
   "exists", "becomes" or "represents" unless the Latin says so), and keep the mode adverb where he puts
   it (*est sacramentaliter corpus Christi* "is sacramentally the body of Christ"). ⛔ Never soften "is"
   into "signifies" or harden "figuratively" into "really": the difference is the treatise's matter.
   Demonstrative pronouns (*hoc*, *istud*) under discussion: render "this", and keep their gender
   visible in a C note where the argument turns on it (*hoc* neuter against *hic*, 348).
   **Propositions in indirect speech** whose sense is under discussion: render as the quoted proposition
   ("who say 'this is an accident without a subject'"), not "who say that …", which asserts it.

## Scripture

`python3 scripts/w3/bible.py "I Cor 10:16"` (Vulgate + Douay–Rheims; psalms in Vulgate numbering) or
`python3 scripts/w3/bible.py --find "panis quem frangimus"`. Where Wyclif's Latin agrees with the
Clementine Vulgate, use the **Douay–Rheims wording**. Where he departs, translate *his* Latin and write
an **S** note giving the Vulgate. Modern references in the English (1 Cor. 10:16). The chapter numbers
are Wyclif's, the verse numbers Loserth's (the headnote says so once).

## Notes

- `[^n]` from 1, the marker placed in the same edit as its note, each opening with a type letter **with a
  full stop** (`**C.**`; the site strips only that form): **T** text · **C** construal · **G** glossary
  (passage-specific only; otherwise a tag) · **S** source · **R** reception/context (a manuscript's
  marginal note Loserth prints; Hus's or the Hussites' reuse where Loserth notes it). A note that does two
  jobs takes the combined code (`**S/T.**`, `**C/S.**`; lint accepts it). The first occurrence of a CONTEXTUAL
  row in each chunk (*sentencia*, *inconveniens*) always gets its **C** note.
- **Density: about one note per 70–100 Latin words**, fewer where the text is plain. Short, factual,
  says what the Latin does and stops. No modern theology, no evaluation, ⛔ no judgement on whose
  eucharistic doctrine is right.
- **Every identification** other than scripture checked with bible.py gets a ledger row in your report
  with a status: `editor` (Loserth's source reference at the page foot), `to-verify` (from memory: every
  patristic, scholastic or canon-law identification you did not read in this session), `verified` (you
  read the source text this session: say where; local PL at `~/patrologia/sources/pl/tei/`). ⛔ Never
  pass memory off as verified. Id `K<chunk>-<n>` (`K01a-1`; ⚠ `K`, since `E` is *De ecclesia*, `P`
  *De potestate pape*, `I` *De incarnacione*), cited in the note: "(LEDGER K01a-1)". Loserth's references
  to the *Corpus iuris canonici* are `editor`; give them in modern form (*De cons.* D. 2 c. 42) and say
  the form is ours. Expect above all: Gratian *De consecratione* D. 2 (*Ego Berengarius*, c. 42;
  Augustine and Ambrose there), Augustine (*In Ioh.*, *De civ. Dei*, sermons), Ambrose *De sacramentis*
  and *De mysteriis*, Hilary, Jerome, Bernard, Thomas (*ST* III qq. 73–83; *In IV Sent.*), Scotus,
  the Lombard *Sent.* IV d. 8–13, Grosseteste.

## Model of register

`pilots/wyc-ecclesia-01a.md` (De ecclesia pp. 1–5) is a reviewed model of register and note style: read
it for that only (it predates some GLOSSARY rulings; **GLOSSARY governs**). **The first chunk, `prol-a`** (the compendium), carries
the `## Headnote` for the whole volume; `pen01` carries a short headnote for *De penitencia* and `quest` one for the
*Questio* (date, sigla, Loserth's remarks on the text). The headnote ⛔ is **not** the card's thesis paragraph: "The move" is how the compendium *builds* the case, chapter by chapter, and names no adversary the chunk does not name; the date is given as Loserth's evidence plus the modern dating, each `[verify]`. The headnote (CONVENTIONS §12 order: occasion, text, the work's move, where it is answered; date,
editor, the two works and their sigla, the compendium, the *Questio*), each unverified claim marked
`[verify]`.

## Transcription notes

The variant list is either complete against the page-foot apparatus or headed "selected"; none that affects the
English may be left out. Plate readings and fixes to the Latin (stray stops that were ink flecks) are recorded
there.

## Side-notes

Already read against the plates (WORKFLOW 5, `text/eucharistia/sidenotes.fixed.tsv`) and placed in your
scaffold's section. ⛔ Do not edit them. One that is plainly wrong (garbled, or at the wrong line):
report it under Latin doubts as `side-note page.line`.

## Finish

1. `status: translated` in the front matter (nothing else changes there).
2. `.venv/bin/python scripts/w3/lint.py chunks/eucharistia/<your chunk>.md` until clean.
3. The four-class check above, sentence by sentence.
4. ⛔ Edit **only your chunk(s)**. No git, no other files. Everything shared goes in your report.

## Report (≤ 200 words per chunk, exactly these heads)

- **Chunk:** id, Latin words, notes.
- **Ledger rows:** in LEDGER.md's table format `| id | chunk / note | claim | status | how / next step |`.
- **Glossary proposals:** Latin · proposed English · where · why.
- **Latin doubts:** page.line · printed · suspicion · settled on the plate?
