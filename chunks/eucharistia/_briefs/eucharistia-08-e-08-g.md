# Translation brief: eucharistia 08-e–08-g

You translate these 3 chunk(s) of Wyclif's *Tractatus de eucharistia* in a single pass. Everything you need is in this file:
the working card, the glossary rows these chunks use, and for each chunk its scaffold and the editor's
apparatus for its pages. Work so as to use few tool calls:

1. Read this brief once (it is the only file you need to read, unless the card names one for your chunk).
2. For each chunk, write the COMPLETE chunk file ONCE with the Write tool to its path (given in the chunk's
   header below): the scaffold with `status: translated`, the title, the English after every Latin block,
   headings and side-notes as the card says, Notes, and Transcription notes, in the card's
   layout. Never alter the Latin. Do not make a series of small edits.
3. Use the apparatus given here for variants (the card's rule: a variant that gives the sense is translated
   with a T note citing the siglum; otherwise translate the print and flag it). Open a plate image only if a
   word cannot be construed at all from the print plus the apparatus; otherwise flag it as a Latin doubt.
4. Scripture: quote the Douay-Rheims as you know it. At the END, check every reference you quoted in ONE
   command: `cd /Users/wilsonpruitt/wyclif && .venv/bin/python scripts/w3/bible.py "Ref 1" "Ref 2" ...` and fix any wording
   that differs, in the same chunk file (this is the one allowed round of edits).
5. Run `cd /Users/wilsonpruitt/wyclif && .venv/bin/python scripts/w3/lint.py chunks/eucharistia/wyc-eucharistia-08-e.md chunks/eucharistia/wyc-eucharistia-08-f.md chunks/eucharistia/wyc-eucharistia-08-g.md` once and fix what it reports.
6. Final message: per chunk, the ledger rows (table: id | chunk / note | claim | status | how / next step),
   glossary proposals, Latin doubts, and a one-line note of anything the coordinator must decide.

Standing rules (from the *De ecclesia* briefs, 2026-10-02):
- Do NOT search the Patrologia or other sources; a separate checker verifies them afterwards. Give the
  editor's reference, the modern form in the English, and "to be checked" with a fresh LEDGER id per item
  (never reuse an id).
- Notes open with their bold class codes, `**S/C.**`, never bare letters mid-note. No process words in
  the notes ("the report", "the coordinator", "brief").
- OCR scars (stray English or margin letters, line numbers read as words, glued or broken words,
  numerals read as letters) stay out of the chunk: translate the print's word and list each scar in your
  final message only (page.line, token, likely print reading). The coordinator fixes the Latin.
- Flag every place the established Latin may have LOST a word (it does not construe, especially at a page
  head or foot) or DOUBLED one: page.line and the suspicion. Translate the print as it stands; supply a
  missing word only in brackets with a T note. The editor's print governs; list any departure.


## The working card

# TRANSLATOR CARD — one *De eucharistia* chunk

This card replaces reading CONVENTIONS, the pilot and Thakkar in full: it is their working core.
Adapted from `chunks/potestate-pape/CARD.md` (Loserth's other volume) with the B+ lessons of
`chunks/incarnacione/CARD.md` (2026-11-06; **reviewed 2026-11-06** on `prol-a`: `_review/REVIEW-prol-a.md`). Read it, then `GLOSSARY.md`,
then your scaffold (or your brief, which carries all three). Consult CONVENTIONS.md only when the card sends
you there. Work in `~/wyclif`. Wyclif is approached with **daggers drawn**: the most recent English
versions were "worse than useless" because of four error classes (below). Your English must survive
a hostile reader with the Latin open.

## Work lean (cost is per tool call: each call re-sends your whole context)

1. One call reading what you need (the brief, or CARD + GLOSSARY + scaffold).
2. **One** `bible.py` call with every scripture reference you need (it takes many refs).
3. Plates **only** for a Latin doubt the print plus apparatus cannot settle.
4. Write each finished chunk in **one** Write of the whole file (Latin blocks copied unchanged).
5. Lint once; fix; done. Draft in your head, not in the file.

## The volume

*Tractatus de eucharistia* and *Tractatus de penitencia sive de confessione*, ed. Johann Loserth (Wyclif
Society, 1892), from the plates of archive.org `latinworks13wycl` (**leaf = page + 71**; leaf images in
`text/eucharistia/raw/leaves/`). Three texts:

Chunk ids: `prol-a … prol-c` the compendium, `01-a … 09-n` the nine chapters, `pen01 … pen06` *De
penitencia*, `quest` the *Questio*.

- **pp. 1–10, the compendium** (*Sentencia tractatus de Eukaristia in compendio*, under "Prologus"): a
  medieval summary of the nine chapters that came down with the work. Translate it like the text.
- **pp. 11–326, the *Tractatus de eucharistia* (maior)**, nine long chapters. Written in Wyclif's last
  years, before 1382–83 (Loserth, Introd. §4: it shares passages word for word with *Sermones* III, and
  it avoids the words *substancia* and *materialis* of the bread, which Wyclif says in *Sermo* III.54 he
  has stopped using). Wyclif's case against the "modern" doctrine: that the consecrated host is in its
  nature bread and wine and sacramentally, figuratively, the body and blood of Christ; that an accident
  without a subject is impossible; that the decree *Ego Berengarius* (*De cons.* D. 2 c. 42) is the
  faith of the ancient Roman church; against the friars, Thomas, Scotus and "the sect of the signs".
  A **treatise**: Wyclif speaks in the first person, states conclusions, raises objections and answers
  them. The tractatus minor (the *Confessio*) is NOT in this volume (Shirley, *Fasc. Ziz.*).
- **pp. 327–348, *De eucharistia et penitencia sive de confessione*** in six chapters (only ch. 1 is on
  the eucharist; the rest is penance and auricular confession), then the short ***Questio ad fratres de
  sacramento altaris*** (pp. 347–348, its first part only: Loserth notes that the rest of the
  manuscript's text is not on the sacrament, and is Hus's).

**Sigla. ⚠ They differ between the two works.** *De eucharistia* (Introd. §5): **A** Vienna 3927;
**B** Vienna 3932; **C** Vienna 1387 ("the best of the three" Vienna MSS, correcting A and B); **D** Prague
Univ. IV D 22 (1404–05, Andreas of Kouřim); **E** Prague Univ. XI E 3 (1460; Loserth: "the best and most
reliable text of all the five"). Loserth's lettering "does not in any way refer to their respective
value". The Vienna MSS are one group, the Prague MSS another. *De penitencia* (Introd. §6): **A** Vienna
3927; **B** Bautzen, Gersdorf Library M. St. 80.7; **C** Vienna 1337; **D** Prague Univ. III G 11; **E**
Vienna 3980; **F** Vienna 4527. Cite variants with the sigla of the work you are in. Marginal notes in the
manuscripts that Loserth prints ("F in marg.", "DB in marg.") are reception: an **R** note where they
show how a reader took the text.

**The page foot** (in your brief as "apparatus", by page) has two blocks, both keyed to the **line**:
the variants (`19. C: ecclesie in marg. alia manu.`) and Loserth's source references. The OCR of it is
rough: read it for sense, not letter by letter, and read the plate foot where a variant matters.

## The job

The Latin in your scaffold is **established and frozen** (blind transcription of the plates, checked word
by word against a four-scan vote; residue read on the plate). Fill `[TITLE]` (short, lower case: "the
three opinions on the quiddity of the host"), each `[ENGLISH]`, the notes and the transcription notes;
set `status: translated`; lint; report.

- **Headings:** keep `## ¶k · range` exactly. **Never change a range; never split a paragraph.**
- **Never alter the Latin.** A transcription error you find (a stray mark, a broken word, a side-note
  word in the text) is REPORTED, never repaired in your file: the coordinator repairs the transcription
  (`text/eucharistia/bt/pNNN.txt`) and refreshes the chunk's Latin. A word that looks wrong: read the
  apparatus for that line first; then, if still doubtful, the plate (`text/eucharistia/raw/leaves/nLEAF.jpg`,
  LEAF = page + 71 padded to four digits: p. 1 = `n0072.jpg`). A variant that gives the sense → translate
  it + **T** note citing the siglum; a compelling emendation → translate it + **T** note "(our
  emendation)"; neither → translate the print and flag it. Never smooth nonsense into sense. Report every
  such case. **Loserth's printed text governs** (ruled 2026-10-02 for Loserth's volumes; the
  manuscripts-outrank-the-print rule is Harris's volumes only): translate it, his own emendations
  included, unless it will not construe; a manuscript reading is chosen only then, or where the source
  Wyclif quotes, read this session, agrees with it. Every departure gets a T note giving both readings.
- **The compendia (`prol-a … prol-c`) summarise chapters whose Latin is already established** in this
  directory. Where the compendium's ellipsis leaves a construal open (whose argument, which *per* phrase is a
  ground and which a means), grep the chapter's `>` blocks, follow them, and cite the page in the **C** note:
  that is construal, not source verification, and one call. (`prol-a` 2.1–5: the three decrees are the
  objections' grounds, ch. 1 pp. 24, 25, 28.)
- **English layout:** `[N]` at the same word as `[p. N]` in the Latin (the chunk's first `[p. N]` is
  implicit). Supplied words in `[brackets]`, sparingly, ⛔ never in italics. **Quotations** (a quotation running on across ¶s or into the next chunk opens each ¶ with a double quote and closes only at its end; quotations inside it take single quotes) in quotation
  marks. Your brief carries Loserth's **italic runs** per page where the scan's OCR gives them (rough;
  ⚠ page numbers drift: a run not in your page's Latin belongs to a neighbouring page): they are
  the editor's judgement of where a quotation runs, not the manuscript's: follow them by default, depart
  where the source shows otherwise (say so in a note). Reviews do not check quotation bounds against the
  italics. Italicised scripture inside indirect speech is quoted too; where quoting would garble the
  sentence, leave it unquoted and give the reference in an **S** note.
- **Ordinals:** a degree-sign ordinal can print or OCR like a two-digit number (*30 et 10* = 3° and 1°).
  Read both forms the same way, and check the plate when a citation looks impossible.
- **Formulae of the disputation** (ruled 2026-10-01; fixed renderings, tagged only where GLOSSARY has a
  row): *instatur* "it is objected" · *obicitur* "it is objected" · *arguitur* "it is argued" (with
  *per*: GLOSSARY) · *dicitur* "it is said" (in an answer: "the answer is") · *respondetur* "the reply is"
  · *conclusio* "conclusion" · *antecedens / consequens* "antecedent / consequent" · *consequencia*
  "inference", ⛔ never "consequence" · *patet* "it is clear" · *supponitur* "it is supposed" ·
  *probatur* "proof:" or "it is proved" · *confirmatur* "this is confirmed" · *solvit / dissolvit* (an objection) "resolves", both (never "answers", which belongs to *respondetur / dicitur*).
- **A source note says only what the Latin says about the source** (who narrates, which book, which work)
  and leaves the rest to the ledger: never supply a story the Latin rules out (*narratum a beato Gregorio*:
  Gregory narrates).
- **Citation formulae:** *ubi supra* "in the place cited above" (⛔ never a claim about where a passage
  stands), *ut supra* "as above", *infra* "below". *Utrobique* "on both sides / in both places".

## The four error classes (Thakkar) — check every sentence

1. **Terms:** GLOSSARY.md governs, one term one rendering. Tag the **first occurrence in the chunk** of
   every §A–C term: `[accident]{g:accidens}`; a multi-word key is lower case with hyphens, `{g:corpus-christi}`, `{g:a-simili}` (lint rejects spaces); never nest brackets inside a tag (`[form [sounds] with]{g:k}` breaks the site): tag the bare word. The key must exist in GLOSSARY.md. A term that looks
   technical but has no row: render it sensibly, untagged, and propose it in your report.
   **CONTEXTUAL** rows hold two senses English splits: choose by context and write a **C** note at the
   first occurrence in the chunk and wherever it leans to the other sense (the dikaiosune rule,
   CONVENTIONS §6).
   Rows that already exist and bear on this volume: *accidens* "accident" · *accidens absolutum*
   "absolute accident" · *transsubstanciacio* "transubstantiation" · *conficere* "consecrate (the
   eucharist)" · *figura / figuratum* "figure / thing figured" · *res sacramenti* "reality of the
   sacrament" · *sacramentalia* "sacramentals" · *quantus* "quantified" · *per se / per accidens* "of
   itself / by accident" · *sensibile commune* "common sensible" · *ecclesia* church (**lower-case**) ·
   *caritas* charity · *sentencia* teaching (and *sentencia verborum* "sense", a separate row) · *ex fide* as faith teaches ·
   *opinio* opinion · *novelli* the newer [doctors] · *sancti* the saints · *concludere* infer ("conclude" only where a
   conclusion is literally drawn) · *deduccio* deduction · *maneries* kind · *principaliter* as a main head ·
   *sensibilis* perceptible · *declarare / ostendere* make clear / show · *ecclesia* is tagged at its first
   occurrence in every chunk.
   **This volume's vocabulary is now ruled (2026-11-06, `prol-a` review):** *sacramentum* (the eucharist) ·
   *hostia* host · *panis / vinum* bread / wine · *calix* chalice · *corpus Christi / Domini* kept apart ·
   *remanencia* the remaining · *accidens sine subiecto* · *substancia · quantitas · qualitas* · *esse /
   esse sacramentale* being / sacramental being · *esus / manducacio* eating · *confeccio* consecration ·
   *secta signorum* · *novella / antiqua ecclesia* · *predicacio ydemptica / tropica* identical / tropical
   predication. **The mode adverbs, one word each, never merged, each tagged at first occurrence:**
   *sacramentaliter* sacramentally · *realiter* really (never "actually") · *vere* truly (never "really") ·
   *spiritualiter* spiritually · *virtualiter* virtually · *figurative* figuratively · *tropice* tropically ·
   *ydemptice* identically · *invisibiliter* invisibly · *sensibiliter* perceptibly · *corporaliter* bodily ·
   *substancialiter* substantially · *dimensionaliter* dimensionally. A term still missing a row (*ydemptificacio*,
   *conversio*, *fractio*, *confessio auricularis*, *absolucio*, *claves* …): render it sensibly, untagged, and
   propose it. *Ego Berengarius* stays as the decree's title (Wyclif's spelling *Beringarius* in the Latin;
   "Berengar" for the man in the English). In ch. 1, *res sacramenti* "reality of the sacrament" is a ruled
   row: the compendium's *de rebus huius sacramenti* (1.3) is the three-membered distinction the chapter sets
   out, so keep its *res* consistent with that row.
2. **Connectives carry the argument.** ⛔ Never omit one, never turn one into filler.

   | Latin | English | Never |
   |---|---|---|
   | enim, nam | for | "now", "indeed" |
   | ergo, igitur, ideo | therefore, so, then | "now", "and", "indeed" |
   | sed / autem, marking the **minor premiss or next step** | now | (omitted) |
   | sed / autem, adversative | but | (omitted) |
   | autem, continuative | and | (omitted), and **not "now"** |
   | cum (concessive / causal) | although / since | "whenever" |
   | tamen | yet, nevertheless | "therefore" |
   | item | again, also | "now" |
   | vero (continuative) | and; but (adversative) | "now", "truly" |
   | verumtamen | nevertheless | "but truly" |
   | unde | hence, so | "whence" (archaic), "where" |
   | per idem | by the same token | "in the same way" |
   | ymmo | indeed, rather (correcting upward) | (omitted) |
   | patet; constat | it is clear; it is evident | |

   "Now" is reserved for the minor premiss, or the step that brings a new premiss to bear. An *autem*
   that only extends the same step is "and". ⚠ The commonest error in *De ecclesia* (close-out, ~50 of
   69 connective fixes): a *sed* that brings the minor premiss of a syllogism closed by *ergo / ideo /
   igitur* rendered "but". Before writing "but" for a *sed*, look ahead for the *ergo*: if one follows,
   it is "now".
3. **Ordinary words with a medieval sense:** GLOSSARY §D; look up any word whose classical and
   Wyclifite senses may differ, and propose additions.
4. **Syntax:** construe before rendering (main verb, subject, what every relative and genitive hangs
   on). Keep quantifier order where it is meaning. Keep Wyclif's long periods where English tolerates
   them. **A doubtful construal is never chosen silently:** translate the likelier reading and write a
   **C** note giving the alternative.
   ⚠ **Predication is the matter here, as in *De incarnacione*.** *Hoc est corpus meum*, *panis est
   corpus Christi*, *hoc sacramentum est panis*: Wyclif argues about what the pronoun demonstrates and
   in what mode the predicate holds. Keep subject and predicate in his order, keep *est* as "is" (never
   "exists", "becomes" or "represents" unless the Latin says so), and keep the mode adverb where he puts
   it (*est sacramentaliter corpus Christi* "is sacramentally the body of Christ"). ⛔ Never soften "is"
   into "signifies" or harden "figuratively" into "really": the difference is the treatise's matter.
   Demonstrative pronouns (*hoc*, *istud*) under discussion: render "this", and keep their gender
   visible in a C note where the argument turns on it (*hoc* neuter against *hic*, 348).
   **Propositions in indirect speech** whose sense is under discussion: render as the quoted proposition
   ("who say 'this is an accident without a subject'"), not "who say that …", which asserts it.

## Scripture

`python3 scripts/w3/bible.py "I Cor 10:16"` (Vulgate + Douay–Rheims; psalms in Vulgate numbering) or
`python3 scripts/w3/bible.py --find "panis quem frangimus"`. Where Wyclif's Latin agrees with the
Clementine Vulgate, use the **Douay–Rheims wording**. Where he departs, translate *his* Latin and write
an **S** note giving the Vulgate. Modern references in the English (1 Cor. 10:16). The chapter numbers
are Wyclif's, the verse numbers Loserth's (the headnote says so once).

## Notes

- `[^n]` from 1, the marker placed in the same edit as its note, each opening with a type letter **with a
  full stop** (`**C.**`; the site strips only that form): **T** text · **C** construal · **G** glossary
  (passage-specific only; otherwise a tag) · **S** source · **R** reception/context (a manuscript's
  marginal note Loserth prints; Hus's or the Hussites' reuse where Loserth notes it). A note that does two
  jobs takes the combined code (`**S/T.**`, `**C/S.**`; lint accepts it). The first occurrence of a CONTEXTUAL
  row in each chunk (*sentencia*, *inconveniens*) always gets its **C** note.
- **Density: about one note per 70–100 Latin words**, fewer where the text is plain. Short, factual,
  says what the Latin does and stops. No modern theology, no evaluation, ⛔ no judgement on whose
  eucharistic doctrine is right.
- **Every identification** other than scripture checked with bible.py gets a ledger row in your report
  with a status: `editor` (Loserth's source reference at the page foot), `to-verify` (from memory: every
  patristic, scholastic or canon-law identification you did not read in this session), `verified` (you
  read the source text this session: say where; local PL at `~/patrologia/sources/pl/tei/`). ⛔ Never
  pass memory off as verified. Id `K<chunk>-<n>` (`K01a-1`; ⚠ `K`, since `E` is *De ecclesia*, `P`
  *De potestate pape*, `I` *De incarnacione*), cited in the note: "(LEDGER K01a-1)". Loserth's references
  to the *Corpus iuris canonici* are `editor`; give them in modern form (*De cons.* D. 2 c. 42) and say
  the form is ours. Expect above all: Gratian *De consecratione* D. 2 (*Ego Berengarius*, c. 42;
  Augustine and Ambrose there), Augustine (*In Ioh.*, *De civ. Dei*, sermons), Ambrose *De sacramentis*
  and *De mysteriis*, Hilary, Jerome, Bernard, Thomas (*ST* III qq. 73–83; *In IV Sent.*), Scotus,
  the Lombard *Sent.* IV d. 8–13, Grosseteste.

## Model of register

`pilots/wyc-ecclesia-01a.md` (De ecclesia pp. 1–5) is a reviewed model of register and note style: read
it for that only (it predates some GLOSSARY rulings; **GLOSSARY governs**). **The first chunk, `prol-a`** (the compendium), carries
the `## Headnote` for the whole volume; `pen01` carries a short headnote for *De penitencia* and `quest` one for the
*Questio* (date, sigla, Loserth's remarks on the text). The headnote ⛔ is **not** the card's thesis paragraph: "The move" is how the compendium *builds* the case, chapter by chapter, and names no adversary the chunk does not name; the date is given as Loserth's evidence plus the modern dating, each `[verify]`. The headnote (CONVENTIONS §12 order: occasion, text, the work's move, where it is answered; date,
editor, the two works and their sigla, the compendium, the *Questio*), each unverified claim marked
`[verify]`.

## Transcription notes

The variant list is either complete against the page-foot apparatus or headed "selected"; none that affects the
English may be left out. Plate readings and fixes to the Latin (stray stops that were ink flecks) are recorded
there.

## Side-notes

Already read against the plates (WORKFLOW 5, `text/eucharistia/sidenotes.fixed.tsv`) and placed in your
scaffold's section. ⛔ Do not edit them. One that is plainly wrong (garbled, or at the wrong line):
report it under Latin doubts as `side-note page.line`.

## Finish

1. `status: translated` in the front matter (nothing else changes there).
2. `.venv/bin/python scripts/w3/lint.py chunks/eucharistia/<your chunk>.md` until clean.
3. The four-class check above, sentence by sentence.
4. ⛔ Edit **only your chunk(s)**. No git, no other files. Everything shared goes in your report.

## Report (≤ 200 words per chunk, exactly these heads)

- **Chunk:** id, Latin words, notes.
- **Ledger rows:** in LEDGER.md's table format `| id | chunk / note | claim | status | how / next step |`.
- **Glossary proposals:** Latin · proposed English · where · why.
- **Latin doubts:** page.line · printed · suspicion · settled on the plate?

## Glossary (the 477 rows these chunks use; the full file is GLOSSARY.md)

# GLOSSARY — FROZEN 2026-09-28 (Wilson's pilot review)

*One Latin term, one English rendering, every time, across the whole corpus. A reader must be able
to recognise the same word coming back, because Wyclif's arguments turn on it. A rendering changes
only by a dated decision in CONVENTIONS' decision log, never silently in a chunk. Entries may be
*added* by recorded decision as new terms appear. **Tag keys:** a chunk tags a term as
`[English]{g:latin-form}` (CONVENTIONS §11), and the key must match a Latin form in one of the rows
below. These rows are also the source of the site's hover glossary. Where a term has two senses,
the entry says so and each chunk's note picks one. A term marked **CONTEXTUAL** holds together
senses English splits: its English is chosen by context, under the dikaiosune rule (CONVENTIONS §6).*

**Sources of the decisions.** "Pilot" = settled in `pilots/` this session. "T. p. N" = Mark
Thakkar, "Duces caecorum," *Vivarium* 58 (2020), page N (`reference/`), which documents the
errors of the two most recent translations. His corrections are adopted here unless an entry says
otherwise.

**Orthography.** Headwords are given in the Society editions' medieval spelling (*eciam*,
*racio*, *quiditas*, *ymmo*), because that is what the translator will meet on the page.

## A. The church

| Latin | English | Note |
|---|---|---|
| ecclesia | church | Lower-case in English except in a proper title. |
| ecclesia militans / triumphans / dormiens | the church militant / triumphant / sleeping | *Dormiens* = the souls in purgatory. Not "dormant". |
| pars peregrinans; peregrinari | the pilgrim part; to be a pilgrim | Augustine's *peregrinatio* (Ench. 56). Pilot. |
| predestinatus, -i | the predestinate (sg. "a predestinate [person]") | Never "the elect", which is *electi* and gets "the elect". |
| prescitus, -i | **the foreknown** | ⭐ Wyclif's technical term for those God foreknows will be damned. It is **not** "the reprobate" (*reprobi* → "the reprobate"). Explain it in a note at its first occurrence in **each work**. The English word misleads on its own and Penn explains it only once (T. p. 361 n. 12). Pilot. |
| via / patria | the way / the homeland | *Beatitudo patrie* → "the blessedness of the homeland". Pilot. The earthly sense (one's native country) is also "homeland"; a note where it matters (*Dial.* 54.2). |
| corpus Christi misticum | the mystical body of Christ | |
| mater nostra | our mother | Church as mother is the governing figure of *De ecclesia* I. |
| fides formata / informis | formed faith / unformed faith | Faith formed by charity. Pilot. |
| fides explicita / implicita | explicit faith / implicit faith | The scholastic pair (*Dial.* 28.16–17). Ruled 2026-09-28. |
| infidelis | unbeliever; with a dative, faithless (to) | Two senses by construction. Pairs with *infidelitas*, unbelief. Ruled 2026-09-28 (10 sites). |
| Christicole | worshippers of Christ | Ruled 2026-09-28. |
| litere fraternitatum | letters of fraternity | Friars' letters admitting a benefactor to the order's suffrages. Ruled 2026-09-28 (4 sites). |
| universitas fidelium | the whole body of the faithful | Ruled 2026-10-02 (*Eccl.* 37.13). |
| ecclesiastici | CONTEXTUAL: clergy / those who belong to the church | Usually the clergy; where Wyclif means every member of the church (*Eccl.* 81.4) render "those who belong to the church" and write a **C** note. Ruled 2026-10-02. |
| ecclesia laycalis / secularis | the lay church / the secular church | Ruled 2026-10-02 (154.15, 156.3). |
| sacramentum (the eucharist); sacramentum altaris | sacrament; the sacrament of the altar | The plain sense, against the Augustinian row (*Incarn.*). Ruled 2026-11-06 (coordinator, delegated; *Euch.* prol-a 1.3, 3.30). |
| panis / vinum | bread / wine | Ruled 2026-11-06 (coordinator, delegated; *Euch.* prol-a 2.8). |

# *De eucharistia*, chapter 8, part 5: [TITLE]

## ¶1 · 247.29–249.11

> [p. 247] Quantum ad materiam de augmentacione et diminucione, dictum est alibi quomodo in homine ad unitatem spiritus qui est persona hominis non est [p. 248] difficultas quomodo fit augmentacio per humidum cibale, generata parva forma in ipso, ut puta forma carnis, ossis vel talis partis simplicis ac composite, ymmo non obest animam vegetativam eciam animam sensitivam generari que subordinetur anime ultimate; nec valet quod illa forma sit pars quantitativa forme tocius, sed satis est quod sit forma subordinata forme tocius a qua ista parcialis substancia habeat quidditatem, sicut totum corpus habet quidditatem suam a forma tocius; de multiplicacione vero formarum tam animarum quam formarum mixtorum dictum est diffuse alibi, sicut de ordine augmentandi et quomodo non oportet formam ultimam maiorari vel minorari, licet forme parcium adveniant vel recedant. In lignis autem in quibus est anima vegetativa est super hec quedam diversitas, quoniam communiter est per processum temporis novum lignum; et illud successivum communiter augmentatur et diminuitur et illud successivum individuatur a suis elementis et tunc est maius nunc autem minus (ut hic supponitur tanquam alibi declaratum). Quoad auctoritatem Christi Math. XV patet quod exsufflandi sunt ut infidelissimi qui dicunt Jesum nostrum nescire philosophica in hac parte. Oportet enim ipsos cognoscere virtutem sermonis et sensum ad quem hec dixit ille, cui cuncta subserviunt; habet autem sermo Christi sic: Non intelligitis quod omne quod intrat in os in ventrem vadit et in secessum emittitur? que autem procedunt de ore, de corde exeunt et ea coinquinant hominem. Et narrat consequenter septem que coinquinant hominem; [p. 249] ubi patet primo quod Christus non reprobaret carenciam intellectus Petri cum suis sociis superaddendo eis expositivam sentenciam nisi foret subtilis, verissima et salubris; secundo patet quod primo loquitur de ore corporis correspondenter ad Judeos carnales qui ritus corporeos observabant; et tercio loquitur de ore mentis correspondenter ad patres legis nove qui debent per corpora immunda vel communia ut animalia et alia prohibita in lege veteri precavicionem a contagione peccati notare, ut docet Augustinus in libro contra Faustum.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶2 · 249.12–249.26

> [p. 249] Et tercio pro subtilitate sermonum Christi notandum primo quod Christus primo intelligit secundum distribucionem accomodam pertinentem quod omnis pars alimenti inmunda transiens per digestiones completas coinquinat hominem inquinamento corporali, cum purum alimenti separatum fuerit ab inpuro; ideo textus Marc. VIIᵐᵒ, 18, 19 habet sic: Non intelligitis, quia omne extrinsecus introiens in hominem non potest eum coinquinare, quia non introivit in cor eius sed in ventrem et secessum exit purgans omnes escas? Unde et Mattheus narrat hec septem de ore procedere, ut intelligamus os mentis. Et ponit exire cor interioris hominis quod est procedere extra limites racionis. Et patet sensus litteralis infringibilis veritatis.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶3 · 249.27–250.20

> [p. 249] Sed est hoc verbum Christi gravidatum sensu morali multiplici. Primo notatur quod nemo maculatur mentaliter nisi macula originata fuerit a se ipso; secundo notatur quod carnalis observancia pro tempore [p. 250] legis veteris fuit licita sed nunc maculat, cum plene digesta transiit in secessum. Et tercio instruimur quod nullum corporale fetidum maculat mentem hominis nisi a puricia nature bone separatum fuerit et secundum racionem fetoris peccati per abusum innaturalem tanquam vomitus reassumptum. Mille alias subtilitates potest fidelis extrahere de hiis verbis Christi puris ab omni macula falsitatis. Non enim pertinuit sibi plus extense distribuere sed docere, ne sui sint occupati observanciis corporalis alimenti dimissa sollicitudine circa cibum anime spiritualem. Ideo dicit Apostolus Tym. primo: Omnia munda mundis. Et prima Thim. IVᵒ, 4: Omnis creatura Dei bona est et nichil reiciendum, quod cum graciarum accione percipitur, et Iᵃ Cor. Xᵒ, 25: Omne quod in macello venit manducate, nichil interrogantes propter conscienciam. Et hinc redarguendi sunt qui fingunt mendacia ut fidem katholicam quod signum corporis Christi quod est sacramentum blaspheme colatur et cultus signati corporis dominici remittatur.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶4 · 250.21–251.21

> [p. 250] Sed redeundo ad aliam sentenciam Doctoris Communis notandum primo quomodo discrepat ab aliis in materia de mensura; ponit enim multa que dicit alibi esse impossibilia et tunc sunt indubie explicite vel implicite heretica, ut ponit inpossibilitatem composicionis continui ex non quantis; possibilitatem autem immediacionis instancium videtur concedere. Scribitur enim ex parte Thome super IIᵒ Sentenciarum, distinccione IIIᵃ, questione XXVᵗᵃ: Dicendum, inquit, quod est assignare ultimum instans in quo angelus fuit bonus et primum in quo fuit malus; [p. 251] nec inter hec instancia fuit tempus medium, et quia tempus est formaliter numerus, non sequitur ipsum continuitas nisi ex parte motus. Unde cum vicissitudo affeccionum in angelo per quas est bonus et malus non est continua et ordinata ad aliquem motum continuum; numerus tamen earum dicetur tempus, quia secundum prius et posterius se habent, sed non est continuum. Unde inter duo instancia non necessario accipietur tempus medium, sicut nec inter duas unitates numerus. Istud autem dictum viciatum est; sophiste, inquam, Oxonienses dicerent quod vel bonitas angeli desinit esse per remocionem de presenti vel malicia sua cepit per remocionem de presenti, sic quod nec pro eodem instanti fuit sic bonus et malus, nec duo instancia erant immediata, quia per idem Petrus factus sanus immediate post egritudinem, cum sint contraria immediata, causaret immediacionem instancium, et per idem punctus continue fluens super duas lineas contiguas et generaliter mutari unius indivisibilis precedit per instans suum mutatum esse (ut patet alibi).

# *De eucharistia*, chapter 8, part 6: [TITLE]

## ¶1 · 251.22–252.6

> [p. 251] Item, si tempus sit discontinuum, quia est per se numerus et sibi accidit continuacio ex motu, sequitur quod non potest esse tempus nisi discretum; nam non potest esse tempus nisi sit numerus; nec potest esse numerus nisi sit discretum: ergo non potest esse tempus nisi ipsum sit discretum; aliter enim nimis nude arguitur discontinuacio temporis ex hoc quod ipsum est numerus et inponitur magna stulticia Aristoteli dicenti quod numerus est genus temporis; et tamen non potest esse tempus nisi ipsum sit continuum. Cum enim pro tempore casus angeli fuit in [p. 252] mundo motus continuus, videtur quod pari evidencia qua tempus fuit tunc discretum per duo instancia immediata fuit et tunc simul continuum racione motus tunc continui. In mathematicis quidem, cuiusmodi sunt puncta et instancia, non differunt continuacio et contiguacio.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶2 · 252.7–253.16

> [p. 252] Item, probatur generaliter quod in eodem tempore sunt instancia inmediata ex principio huius vie, capiendo ut concessum quod eidem tempori accessit contingenter continuitas ex motu continuo, ut cum asserit tempus potest per se consequi affeccionem angeli; cum ergo angelus continue variat affeccionem ad instans et alia subito generata (ut probabile creditur) vel saltem est possibile, videtur quod pari evidencia quodlibet tempus sit discretum; nam tempus naturaliter prius est quam est motus continuus iuxta hanc viam, quia posset esse in motu affeccionis angelice non existente questionis continuo; cum ergo non prius naturaliter sit quam sit discretum quod est eius essencialis differencia, videtur quod continuacio motus qui hinc tam contingenter accidit, non tollit discrecionem temporis nec addit continuacionem que variet eius naturam; nam signato uno tempore cuius una medietas sit continua et alia discreta omnia argumenta que procederent contra immediacionem instancium procederent eciam contra illud; et possibilitatem huius probant adversarii, ponendo quod Deus continue per medietatem hore creet et annichilet sine interpolacione media angelum et per secundam medietatem hore cesset ab omni tali furia; tunc patet quod nulla est evidencia fienda contra composicionem [p. 253] continui ex non quantis quin pariter procederet contra composicionem talis temporis. Ideo radix huius sentencie stat in composicione permanentis continui ex non quantis. Ad quod arguo ex principiis adversarii, ponendo quod Deus annichilet omne continuum huius mundi sensibilis, servando omnem punctum eius inmotum et creet in omni situ indivisibili unum angelum, ut multiplicet eundem angelum utrobique, et preter hec servet A punctale quod moveatur localiter continue de punctali in punctale, et patet quod foret tunc tempus continuum sicut spacium permanens continuum ex immediacione indivisibilium, et tamen tempus componeretur ex instantibus; omnis enim situs qui ante fuit in mundo foret summe plenus punctalibus, cum non sit dare vacuum, ideo foret situs corporeus eque continuus, ut fuit in principio.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶3 · 253.17–253.22

> [p. 253] Similiter, si in silva, in stellis celi et corporibus similibus distanter positis causatur figura, ut dicunt naturales, perspectivi et geometre, multo magis in indivisibilibus inmediate positis servato undique pleno; nam concessa continuitate loci concedi oportet continuitatem locati.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶4 · 253.23–254.21

> [p. 253] Similiter, una legio angelorum quam fides vocat unum (ut patet Luc. VIIIº, 3o) posset circulariter circumduci, et sic motus localis et tempus inde consequens foret vere continuum; ymmo videtur quod illa legio que est unus angelus foret quodammodo circularis, quia circumduccio foret circularis que requirit continuitatem et continua circularitas illius motus requirit continuitatem subiecti, quod est legio; [p. 254] patet igitur quod nec sensus nec racio indicat nunc continuitatem in mundo quin per idem et tunc foret continuitas utrobique. Nec dubium quin moto tunc continuo a sperico vel punctali foret tunc inmediacio motuum et instancium, sicut foret inmediacio situum indivisibilium; ex quibus componeretur utrobique continuum. Ymmo corpus cubicum haberet correspondenter ad eius punctalia acervum punctalium suppositum et undique circumductum, et omniquaque foret tanta continuitas et sic verum balbutivit hec via vocis sue ignara, quia fuit sibi ipsi manifeste contraria. Nunc itaque tenet Aristotelem nunc negat, nunc tenet leges hominum et nunc negat; nunc tenet decreta ecclesie et nunc negat, nec fundat se in sic variando in fide scripture, ideo vana est testificacio huius vie. Quantum ad dicta Aristotelis katholica de genere accidentis, patet quod ipsa renuit sine causa. Sed alia dicta Aristotelis de composicione continui ex non quantis, ut sentenciant Plato, Augustinus et Lincolniensis, ipsa concedit explicite ad favorem Aristotelis sed negat ipsa implicite.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶5 · 254.22–254.25

> [p. 254] Quantum ad leges hominum, patet quod nunc tantum favit illis quod dicit iudicem propter eas in casu debere contrariari divino iudicio quod ipse dyabolus non auderet concedere.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶6 · 254.26–254.32

> [p. 254] Quantum ad leges ecclesie, patet quod contradicit decreto Nicholai IIⁱ de eukaristia. Sed de indulgenciis sine fundamento scripture vel causa concedit quod episcopus Avinonicus potest meritum supererogatum capere a beatis, ad votum distribuere discolis sine fine. Quis ergo crederet tali viro in isto triplici devio et similibus tanquam testi?

[ENGLISH]

## ¶7 · 255.1–255.23

> [p. 255] Sed forte dicitur quod iste doctor ponit duplex tempus continuum et discretum; discretum componitur ex instantibus mensurantibus motus affeccionis evangelice. Et istam sentenciam tangit Thomas super II° Sentenciarum, distinccione secunda, questione XIIIᵃ: Dicendum, inquit, quod angelus potest considerari dupliciter: vel quantum ad suum esse quod est sine vicissitudine et sic mensuratur evo, vel quantum ad operacionem et sic quoad aliquam operacionem mensuratur eciam evo quoad operacionem qua intuetur res in verbo. In tali enim operacione non est vicissitudo aliqua sed secundum operacionem in qua est vicissitudo mensuratur tempore. Sed ipsum tempus est aliud a tempore quod mensurat motum primi mobilis, quia ista vicissitudo non ordinatur ad illam, nec illud tempus est continuum, sed est numerus discretus vicissitudinis non continue. Continuitas enim accidit tempori ex parte motus numerati. Et ita sicut ponit unum tempus mensurans totam universitatem sensibilem, sic ponit unum evum mensurans totam naturam angelicam secundum suum esse et intelligere permanens quod non est de genere successivi.

> [p. 255] Contra istam ficticiam arguitur primo per hoc, quod nichil est ponendum sine racione philosophica vel testimonio ex scriptura; sed neutrum istorum docet hanc duplicitatem temporis, ergo non est ponenda. Assumptum patet ex hoc quod aliter positum foret sompnium infundabile, irracionabile positum, cum pari evidencia infinita alia forent fingenda contra regulas nature que compendiosiori modo sine superfluitate [p. 256] semper agit, et Deus irracionabiliter oneraret ecclesiam fidelium ad credendum, et veritas oneraret falsitatem atque mendacium; et minor patet per consequens, hoc autem est commune argumentum temptativum, quo opinans cogitur dare evidenciam vie sue.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶2 · 256.6–256.21

> [p. 256] Item, cum tempus sit communis mensura omnium temporaliter se habencium, et omnis angelus (in quantum sic) mutat vicissitudinem temporalem se habet temporaliter, videtur quod tempus commune sufficit mensurare omnem vicissitudinem angeli temporalem; non enim oportet ponere ad hoc novum genus temporis, cum antiquum tempus sufficit numerare illam vicissitudinem, sicut mensurat motum angeli et alias vicissitudines insensibiles; aliter enim oporteret ponere in Deo tempus propter variacionem sue accionis extrinsece quod tempus ipsum mensuret limitacius quam eternitas. Si ergo tempus nostrum sufficeret mensurare eciam Dei creanciam successivam, a pari vel maiori sufficeret mensurare affeccionem angeli successivam; nam tempus meriti mensurat motus intellectus hominis vicissitudinem inplicantes.

> [p. 256] Item, Deus de potencia sua absoluta posset permittere variacionem affeccionis angeli sine hoc quod produceret novum genus temporis, sed mensuraret affecciones sibi succedentes tempore communi; non ergo sequitur ex variacione talium affeccionum novum genus temporis; alias sic: Una affeccio potest esse permanens quantumcunque diuturna mensurata evo, post quam potest alia affeccio permanens succedere, et Deus non foret necessitatus pro mensura unius affeccionis nec pro mensura alterius nec pro instanti temporis medio novum genus temporis procreare, ergo hoc foret Deo possibile; nam commune evangelium [p. 257] sufficeret mensurare sequentem, nec pro instanti temporis potest tempus discretum subito secundum se totum produci, ymmo sicut dicit super distinccione XIᵃ, IVᵗⁱ Sentenciarum quod est dare ultimum tempus et non ultimum instans in quo manebit forma panis et primum instans, in quo erit corpus Christi sub illis accidentibus, ita videtur consequenter dicendum quod est de affeccione angelica variata sine creacione novi generis temporis, cum nec evum potest esse pars temporis nec duo vel finita instancia temporis possunt constituere tempus quantumcunque longum, quia sic foret tempus discretum, per accidens longum tempore nostro continue mensuratum; et patet quod ista ficticia est irracionabilis sine causa.

## ¶4 · 257.15–258.21

> [p. 257] Item, pari evidencia qua crearetur unum novum genus temporis ex vicissitudine affeccionum in uno angelo, et in alio, et sic forent quotlibet tempora simul, quorum nullum foret pars alicuius temporis, quod est inpossibile; et consequencia videtur ex hoc quod non est fingenda racio quare propter unum angelum malum variatum in affeccione variari debet genus temporis quin per idem ad vicissitudinem cuiuscunque, ymmo propter motum localem angeli vel variacionem affeccionis anime, cum motus ille non ordinatur ad motum primi mobilis; non enim scitur vel requiritur quod vicissitudo affeccionis angelice mensuretur per variacionem affeccionis primi angeli tamquam per primam mensuram, quia Deus potest libere variare affeccionem cuiuscunque angeli stante affeccione in quocunque reliquo. Si ergo ista sit mora [p. 258] affeccionis angelice que potest esse tempus et nullum tempus potest per accidens esse tempus, cum tempus sit per se species quantitatis, sequitur quod ista mora est tempus; et iuxta hoc sequitur quod omne evum angeli sit instans temporis vel tempus, quia potest esse tempus vel instans temporis et est quidquid potest esse. Si enim angelus variaret affeccionem suam in futurum, tunc mora istarum duarum affeccionum foret tempus quod haberet unam partem mensurantem primam affeccionem et aliam mensurantem secundam; et cum omne evum non potest esse longius vel brevius, sicut nec instans temporis discreti, sequitur quod omne tale sit equale tempori sempiterno; et ita videtur omne tempus discretum componi solum ex duobus instantibus vel saltem tanto tempori coequari. Ad quid ergo poneretur tale discretum esse tempus in cuius diuturnitate non ponitur certitudo? Nam sicut idem foret angelus, sive duraret perpetuo sive annichilaret cicius vel tardius, sic est de suo evo: ideo philosophi habent dicere quod evitas per accidens est eternitas, sicut accidenter respicit moram temporis.

## ¶5 · 258.22–259.18

> [p. 258] Item, tempus discretum ex affeccione angelorum est prius ac dignius quam tempus nostrum continuum et eque sufficiens ad mensurandum omnem motum vel vicissitudinem sensibilem, ergo superfluit ponere aliud; per hoc enim quod duracio motus primi mobilis sufficit mensurare omnes motus alios ponit secta ista ipsam specialiter esse tempus. Si ergo duracio angelica sufficit prius mensurare ipsum motum, sequitur quod foret tempus ad ipsum et eius duracio solum quando. Nec valet dicere quod vicissitudo angelica non est continua, quia utraque eius medietas que est instans illius temporis est vere continua; cur ergo non totum, cum una pars sequitur immediate ad [p. 259] reliquam, et hoc sufficit ad continuacionem temporis; ymmo videtur quod in quolibet instanti temporis nostri est mutacio vicissitudinis affeccionis angelice; nam angelus videt nedum creaturas in verbo sed in genere proprio; cum ergo angelus videt continue noviter presenciam ac novitatem creature genite pro quolibet instanti temporis nostri, videtur quod continue habet novam noticiam vel modum sciendi. Sicut enim tempus discretum consequitur ad affeccionem vel volicionem angeli, ita sequitur ad intuicionem et quamcunque variacionem ex parte angeli, et ita (ut arguit Doctor Subtilis contra hanc viam) nedum simul forent multa tempora sed numeri angelorum variancium affecciones suas, que tempora ut subiecta et obiecta forent distincta in specie, sed idem angelus in numero secundum variaciones intencionum et affeccionum circa diversa obiecta in specie causaret simul diversa tempora in specie.

p. 255: quod angelus potest considerari dupliciter: vel quantum ad suum esse quod est sine vicissitudine et sic mensuratur evo, vel quantum ad operacionem et sic quoad aliquam operacionem men- | suratur eciam evo quoad operacionem qua intuetur res in verbo. In tali enim operacione non est vicissitudo aliqua sed secundum operacionem in qua est vicissitudo mensuratur tempore. Sed ipsum tempus est aliud a tempore quod mensurat motum primi id mobilis, quia ista vicissitudo non ordinatur ad illam, nec illud tempus est continuum, sed est numerus discretus vicissitudinis non continue. Continuitas enim accidit tempori ex parte motus numerati.
p. 257: quod est dare ultimum | tempus et non ultimum instans in quo manebit forma panis et primum instans, in quo erit corpus Christi sub illis accidentibus,
