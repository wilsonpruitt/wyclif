# Translation brief: eucharistia 05-e–05-g

You translate these 3 chunk(s) of Wyclif's *Tractatus de eucharistia* in a single pass. Everything you need is in this file:
the working card, the glossary rows these chunks use, and for each chunk its scaffold and the editor's
apparatus for its pages. Work so as to use few tool calls:

1. Read this brief once (it is the only file you need to read, unless the card names one for your chunk).
2. For each chunk, write the COMPLETE chunk file ONCE with the Write tool to its path (given in the chunk's
   header below): the scaffold with `status: translated`, the title, the English after every Latin block,
   headings and side-notes as the card says, Notes, and Transcription notes, in the card's
   layout. Never alter the Latin. Do not make a series of small edits.
3. Use the apparatus given here for variants (the card's rule: a variant that gives the sense is translated
   with a T note citing the siglum; otherwise translate the print and flag it). Open a plate image only if a
   word cannot be construed at all from the print plus the apparatus; otherwise flag it as a Latin doubt.
4. Scripture: quote the Douay-Rheims as you know it. At the END, check every reference you quoted in ONE
   command: `cd /Users/wilsonpruitt/wyclif && .venv/bin/python scripts/w3/bible.py "Ref 1" "Ref 2" ...` and fix any wording
   that differs, in the same chunk file (this is the one allowed round of edits).
5. Run `cd /Users/wilsonpruitt/wyclif && .venv/bin/python scripts/w3/lint.py chunks/eucharistia/wyc-eucharistia-05-e.md chunks/eucharistia/wyc-eucharistia-05-f.md chunks/eucharistia/wyc-eucharistia-05-g.md` once and fix what it reports.
6. Final message: per chunk, the ledger rows (table: id | chunk / note | claim | status | how / next step),
   glossary proposals, Latin doubts, and a one-line note of anything the coordinator must decide.

Standing rules (from the *De ecclesia* briefs, 2026-10-02):
- Do NOT search the Patrologia or other sources; a separate checker verifies them afterwards. Give the
  editor's reference, the modern form in the English, and "to be checked" with a fresh LEDGER id per item
  (never reuse an id).
- Notes open with their bold class codes, `**S/C.**`, never bare letters mid-note. No process words in
  the notes ("the report", "the coordinator", "brief").
- OCR scars (stray English or margin letters, line numbers read as words, glued or broken words,
  numerals read as letters) stay out of the chunk: translate the print's word and list each scar in your
  final message only (page.line, token, likely print reading). The coordinator fixes the Latin.
- Flag every place the established Latin may have LOST a word (it does not construe, especially at a page
  head or foot) or DOUBLED one: page.line and the suspicion. Translate the print as it stands; supply a
  missing word only in brackets with a T note. The editor's print governs; list any departure.


## The working card

# TRANSLATOR CARD — one *De eucharistia* chunk

This card replaces reading CONVENTIONS, the pilot and Thakkar in full: it is their working core.
Adapted from `chunks/potestate-pape/CARD.md` (Loserth's other volume) with the B+ lessons of
`chunks/incarnacione/CARD.md` (2026-11-06; **reviewed 2026-11-06** on `prol-a`: `_review/REVIEW-prol-a.md`). Read it, then `GLOSSARY.md`,
then your scaffold (or your brief, which carries all three). Consult CONVENTIONS.md only when the card sends
you there. Work in `~/wyclif`. Wyclif is approached with **daggers drawn**: the most recent English
versions were "worse than useless" because of four error classes (below). Your English must survive
a hostile reader with the Latin open.

## Work lean (cost is per tool call: each call re-sends your whole context)

1. One call reading what you need (the brief, or CARD + GLOSSARY + scaffold).
2. **One** `bible.py` call with every scripture reference you need (it takes many refs).
3. Plates **only** for a Latin doubt the print plus apparatus cannot settle.
4. Write each finished chunk in **one** Write of the whole file (Latin blocks copied unchanged).
5. Lint once; fix; done. Draft in your head, not in the file.

## The volume

*Tractatus de eucharistia* and *Tractatus de penitencia sive de confessione*, ed. Johann Loserth (Wyclif
Society, 1892), from the plates of archive.org `latinworks13wycl` (**leaf = page + 71**; leaf images in
`text/eucharistia/raw/leaves/`). Three texts:

Chunk ids: `prol-a … prol-c` the compendium, `01-a … 09-n` the nine chapters, `pen01 … pen06` *De
penitencia*, `quest` the *Questio*.

- **pp. 1–10, the compendium** (*Sentencia tractatus de Eukaristia in compendio*, under "Prologus"): a
  medieval summary of the nine chapters that came down with the work. Translate it like the text.
- **pp. 11–326, the *Tractatus de eucharistia* (maior)**, nine long chapters. Written in Wyclif's last
  years, before 1382–83 (Loserth, Introd. §4: it shares passages word for word with *Sermones* III, and
  it avoids the words *substancia* and *materialis* of the bread, which Wyclif says in *Sermo* III.54 he
  has stopped using). Wyclif's case against the "modern" doctrine: that the consecrated host is in its
  nature bread and wine and sacramentally, figuratively, the body and blood of Christ; that an accident
  without a subject is impossible; that the decree *Ego Berengarius* (*De cons.* D. 2 c. 42) is the
  faith of the ancient Roman church; against the friars, Thomas, Scotus and "the sect of the signs".
  A **treatise**: Wyclif speaks in the first person, states conclusions, raises objections and answers
  them. The tractatus minor (the *Confessio*) is NOT in this volume (Shirley, *Fasc. Ziz.*).
- **pp. 327–348, *De eucharistia et penitencia sive de confessione*** in six chapters (only ch. 1 is on
  the eucharist; the rest is penance and auricular confession), then the short ***Questio ad fratres de
  sacramento altaris*** (pp. 347–348, its first part only: Loserth notes that the rest of the
  manuscript's text is not on the sacrament, and is Hus's).

**Sigla. ⚠ They differ between the two works.** *De eucharistia* (Introd. §5): **A** Vienna 3927;
**B** Vienna 3932; **C** Vienna 1387 ("the best of the three" Vienna MSS, correcting A and B); **D** Prague
Univ. IV D 22 (1404–05, Andreas of Kouřim); **E** Prague Univ. XI E 3 (1460; Loserth: "the best and most
reliable text of all the five"). Loserth's lettering "does not in any way refer to their respective
value". The Vienna MSS are one group, the Prague MSS another. *De penitencia* (Introd. §6): **A** Vienna
3927; **B** Bautzen, Gersdorf Library M. St. 80.7; **C** Vienna 1337; **D** Prague Univ. III G 11; **E**
Vienna 3980; **F** Vienna 4527. Cite variants with the sigla of the work you are in. Marginal notes in the
manuscripts that Loserth prints ("F in marg.", "DB in marg.") are reception: an **R** note where they
show how a reader took the text.

**The page foot** (in your brief as "apparatus", by page) has two blocks, both keyed to the **line**:
the variants (`19. C: ecclesie in marg. alia manu.`) and Loserth's source references. The OCR of it is
rough: read it for sense, not letter by letter, and read the plate foot where a variant matters.

## The job

The Latin in your scaffold is **established and frozen** (blind transcription of the plates, checked word
by word against a four-scan vote; residue read on the plate). Fill `[TITLE]` (short, lower case: "the
three opinions on the quiddity of the host"), each `[ENGLISH]`, the notes and the transcription notes;
set `status: translated`; lint; report.

- **Headings:** keep `## ¶k · range` exactly. **Never change a range; never split a paragraph.**
- **Never alter the Latin.** A transcription error you find (a stray mark, a broken word, a side-note
  word in the text) is REPORTED, never repaired in your file: the coordinator repairs the transcription
  (`text/eucharistia/bt/pNNN.txt`) and refreshes the chunk's Latin. A word that looks wrong: read the
  apparatus for that line first; then, if still doubtful, the plate (`text/eucharistia/raw/leaves/nLEAF.jpg`,
  LEAF = page + 71 padded to four digits: p. 1 = `n0072.jpg`). A variant that gives the sense → translate
  it + **T** note citing the siglum; a compelling emendation → translate it + **T** note "(our
  emendation)"; neither → translate the print and flag it. Never smooth nonsense into sense. Report every
  such case. **Loserth's printed text governs** (ruled 2026-10-02 for Loserth's volumes; the
  manuscripts-outrank-the-print rule is Harris's volumes only): translate it, his own emendations
  included, unless it will not construe; a manuscript reading is chosen only then, or where the source
  Wyclif quotes, read this session, agrees with it. Every departure gets a T note giving both readings.
- **The compendia (`prol-a … prol-c`) summarise chapters whose Latin is already established** in this
  directory. Where the compendium's ellipsis leaves a construal open (whose argument, which *per* phrase is a
  ground and which a means), grep the chapter's `>` blocks, follow them, and cite the page in the **C** note:
  that is construal, not source verification, and one call. (`prol-a` 2.1–5: the three decrees are the
  objections' grounds, ch. 1 pp. 24, 25, 28.)
- **English layout:** `[N]` at the same word as `[p. N]` in the Latin (the chunk's first `[p. N]` is
  implicit). Supplied words in `[brackets]`, sparingly, ⛔ never in italics. **Quotations** in quotation
  marks. Your brief carries Loserth's **italic runs** per page where the scan's OCR gives them (rough;
  ⚠ page numbers drift: a run not in your page's Latin belongs to a neighbouring page): they are
  the editor's judgement of where a quotation runs, not the manuscript's: follow them by default, depart
  where the source shows otherwise (say so in a note). Reviews do not check quotation bounds against the
  italics. Italicised scripture inside indirect speech is quoted too; where quoting would garble the
  sentence, leave it unquoted and give the reference in an **S** note.
- **Ordinals:** a degree-sign ordinal can print or OCR like a two-digit number (*30 et 10* = 3° and 1°).
  Read both forms the same way, and check the plate when a citation looks impossible.
- **Formulae of the disputation** (ruled 2026-10-01; fixed renderings, tagged only where GLOSSARY has a
  row): *instatur* "it is objected" · *obicitur* "it is objected" · *arguitur* "it is argued" (with
  *per*: GLOSSARY) · *dicitur* "it is said" (in an answer: "the answer is") · *respondetur* "the reply is"
  · *conclusio* "conclusion" · *antecedens / consequens* "antecedent / consequent" · *consequencia*
  "inference", ⛔ never "consequence" · *patet* "it is clear" · *supponitur* "it is supposed" ·
  *probatur* "proof:" or "it is proved" · *confirmatur* "this is confirmed" · *solvit / dissolvit* (an objection) "resolves", both (never "answers", which belongs to *respondetur / dicitur*).
- **A source note says only what the Latin says about the source** (who narrates, which book, which work)
  and leaves the rest to the ledger: never supply a story the Latin rules out (*narratum a beato Gregorio*:
  Gregory narrates).
- **Citation formulae:** *ubi supra* "in the place cited above" (⛔ never a claim about where a passage
  stands), *ut supra* "as above", *infra* "below". *Utrobique* "on both sides / in both places".

## The four error classes (Thakkar) — check every sentence

1. **Terms:** GLOSSARY.md governs, one term one rendering. Tag the **first occurrence in the chunk** of
   every §A–C term: `[accident]{g:accidens}`; a multi-word key is lower case with hyphens, `{g:corpus-christi}`, `{g:a-simili}` (lint rejects spaces); never nest brackets inside a tag (`[form [sounds] with]{g:k}` breaks the site): tag the bare word. The key must exist in GLOSSARY.md. A term that looks
   technical but has no row: render it sensibly, untagged, and propose it in your report.
   **CONTEXTUAL** rows hold two senses English splits: choose by context and write a **C** note at the
   first occurrence in the chunk and wherever it leans to the other sense (the dikaiosune rule,
   CONVENTIONS §6).
   Rows that already exist and bear on this volume: *accidens* "accident" · *accidens absolutum*
   "absolute accident" · *transsubstanciacio* "transubstantiation" · *conficere* "consecrate (the
   eucharist)" · *figura / figuratum* "figure / thing figured" · *res sacramenti* "reality of the
   sacrament" · *sacramentalia* "sacramentals" · *quantus* "quantified" · *per se / per accidens* "of
   itself / by accident" · *sensibile commune* "common sensible" · *ecclesia* church (**lower-case**) ·
   *caritas* charity · *sentencia* teaching (and *sentencia verborum* "sense", a separate row) · *ex fide* as faith teaches ·
   *opinio* opinion · *novelli* the newer [doctors] · *sancti* the saints · *concludere* infer ("conclude" only where a
   conclusion is literally drawn) · *deduccio* deduction · *maneries* kind · *principaliter* as a main head ·
   *sensibilis* perceptible · *declarare / ostendere* make clear / show · *ecclesia* is tagged at its first
   occurrence in every chunk.
   **This volume's vocabulary is now ruled (2026-11-06, `prol-a` review):** *sacramentum* (the eucharist) ·
   *hostia* host · *panis / vinum* bread / wine · *calix* chalice · *corpus Christi / Domini* kept apart ·
   *remanencia* the remaining · *accidens sine subiecto* · *substancia · quantitas · qualitas* · *esse /
   esse sacramentale* being / sacramental being · *esus / manducacio* eating · *confeccio* consecration ·
   *secta signorum* · *novella / antiqua ecclesia* · *predicacio ydemptica / tropica* identical / tropical
   predication. **The mode adverbs, one word each, never merged, each tagged at first occurrence:**
   *sacramentaliter* sacramentally · *realiter* really (never "actually") · *vere* truly (never "really") ·
   *spiritualiter* spiritually · *virtualiter* virtually · *figurative* figuratively · *tropice* tropically ·
   *ydemptice* identically · *invisibiliter* invisibly · *sensibiliter* perceptibly · *corporaliter* bodily ·
   *substancialiter* substantially · *dimensionaliter* dimensionally. A term still missing a row (*ydemptificacio*,
   *conversio*, *fractio*, *confessio auricularis*, *absolucio*, *claves* …): render it sensibly, untagged, and
   propose it. *Ego Berengarius* stays as the decree's title (Wyclif's spelling *Beringarius* in the Latin;
   "Berengar" for the man in the English). In ch. 1, *res sacramenti* "reality of the sacrament" is a ruled
   row: the compendium's *de rebus huius sacramenti* (1.3) is the three-membered distinction the chapter sets
   out, so keep its *res* consistent with that row.
2. **Connectives carry the argument.** ⛔ Never omit one, never turn one into filler.

   | Latin | English | Never |
   |---|---|---|
   | enim, nam | for | "now", "indeed" |
   | ergo, igitur, ideo | therefore, so, then | "now", "and", "indeed" |
   | sed / autem, marking the **minor premiss or next step** | now | (omitted) |
   | sed / autem, adversative | but | (omitted) |
   | autem, continuative | and | (omitted), and **not "now"** |
   | cum (concessive / causal) | although / since | "whenever" |
   | tamen | yet, nevertheless | "therefore" |
   | item | again, also | "now" |
   | vero (continuative) | and; but (adversative) | "now", "truly" |
   | verumtamen | nevertheless | "but truly" |
   | unde | hence, so | "whence" (archaic), "where" |
   | per idem | by the same token | "in the same way" |
   | ymmo | indeed, rather (correcting upward) | (omitted) |
   | patet; constat | it is clear; it is evident | |

   "Now" is reserved for the minor premiss, or the step that brings a new premiss to bear. An *autem*
   that only extends the same step is "and". ⚠ The commonest error in *De ecclesia* (close-out, ~50 of
   69 connective fixes): a *sed* that brings the minor premiss of a syllogism closed by *ergo / ideo /
   igitur* rendered "but". Before writing "but" for a *sed*, look ahead for the *ergo*: if one follows,
   it is "now".
3. **Ordinary words with a medieval sense:** GLOSSARY §D; look up any word whose classical and
   Wyclifite senses may differ, and propose additions.
4. **Syntax:** construe before rendering (main verb, subject, what every relative and genitive hangs
   on). Keep quantifier order where it is meaning. Keep Wyclif's long periods where English tolerates
   them. **A doubtful construal is never chosen silently:** translate the likelier reading and write a
   **C** note giving the alternative.
   ⚠ **Predication is the matter here, as in *De incarnacione*.** *Hoc est corpus meum*, *panis est
   corpus Christi*, *hoc sacramentum est panis*: Wyclif argues about what the pronoun demonstrates and
   in what mode the predicate holds. Keep subject and predicate in his order, keep *est* as "is" (never
   "exists", "becomes" or "represents" unless the Latin says so), and keep the mode adverb where he puts
   it (*est sacramentaliter corpus Christi* "is sacramentally the body of Christ"). ⛔ Never soften "is"
   into "signifies" or harden "figuratively" into "really": the difference is the treatise's matter.
   Demonstrative pronouns (*hoc*, *istud*) under discussion: render "this", and keep their gender
   visible in a C note where the argument turns on it (*hoc* neuter against *hic*, 348).
   **Propositions in indirect speech** whose sense is under discussion: render as the quoted proposition
   ("who say 'this is an accident without a subject'"), not "who say that …", which asserts it.

## Scripture

`python3 scripts/w3/bible.py "I Cor 10:16"` (Vulgate + Douay–Rheims; psalms in Vulgate numbering) or
`python3 scripts/w3/bible.py --find "panis quem frangimus"`. Where Wyclif's Latin agrees with the
Clementine Vulgate, use the **Douay–Rheims wording**. Where he departs, translate *his* Latin and write
an **S** note giving the Vulgate. Modern references in the English (1 Cor. 10:16). The chapter numbers
are Wyclif's, the verse numbers Loserth's (the headnote says so once).

## Notes

- `[^n]` from 1, the marker placed in the same edit as its note, each opening with a type letter **with a
  full stop** (`**C.**`; the site strips only that form): **T** text · **C** construal · **G** glossary
  (passage-specific only; otherwise a tag) · **S** source · **R** reception/context (a manuscript's
  marginal note Loserth prints; Hus's or the Hussites' reuse where Loserth notes it). A note that does two
  jobs takes the combined code (`**S/T.**`, `**C/S.**`; lint accepts it). The first occurrence of a CONTEXTUAL
  row in each chunk (*sentencia*, *inconveniens*) always gets its **C** note.
- **Density: about one note per 70–100 Latin words**, fewer where the text is plain. Short, factual,
  says what the Latin does and stops. No modern theology, no evaluation, ⛔ no judgement on whose
  eucharistic doctrine is right.
- **Every identification** other than scripture checked with bible.py gets a ledger row in your report
  with a status: `editor` (Loserth's source reference at the page foot), `to-verify` (from memory: every
  patristic, scholastic or canon-law identification you did not read in this session), `verified` (you
  read the source text this session: say where; local PL at `~/patrologia/sources/pl/tei/`). ⛔ Never
  pass memory off as verified. Id `K<chunk>-<n>` (`K01a-1`; ⚠ `K`, since `E` is *De ecclesia*, `P`
  *De potestate pape*, `I` *De incarnacione*), cited in the note: "(LEDGER K01a-1)". Loserth's references
  to the *Corpus iuris canonici* are `editor`; give them in modern form (*De cons.* D. 2 c. 42) and say
  the form is ours. Expect above all: Gratian *De consecratione* D. 2 (*Ego Berengarius*, c. 42;
  Augustine and Ambrose there), Augustine (*In Ioh.*, *De civ. Dei*, sermons), Ambrose *De sacramentis*
  and *De mysteriis*, Hilary, Jerome, Bernard, Thomas (*ST* III qq. 73–83; *In IV Sent.*), Scotus,
  the Lombard *Sent.* IV d. 8–13, Grosseteste.

## Model of register

`pilots/wyc-ecclesia-01a.md` (De ecclesia pp. 1–5) is a reviewed model of register and note style: read
it for that only (it predates some GLOSSARY rulings; **GLOSSARY governs**). **The first chunk, `prol-a`** (the compendium), carries
the `## Headnote` for the whole volume; `pen01` carries a short headnote for *De penitencia* and `quest` one for the
*Questio* (date, sigla, Loserth's remarks on the text). The headnote ⛔ is **not** the card's thesis paragraph: "The move" is how the compendium *builds* the case, chapter by chapter, and names no adversary the chunk does not name; the date is given as Loserth's evidence plus the modern dating, each `[verify]`. The headnote (CONVENTIONS §12 order: occasion, text, the work's move, where it is answered; date,
editor, the two works and their sigla, the compendium, the *Questio*), each unverified claim marked
`[verify]`.

## Transcription notes

The variant list is either complete against the page-foot apparatus or headed "selected"; none that affects the
English may be left out. Plate readings and fixes to the Latin (stray stops that were ink flecks) are recorded
there.

## Side-notes

Already read against the plates (WORKFLOW 5, `text/eucharistia/sidenotes.fixed.tsv`) and placed in your
scaffold's section. ⛔ Do not edit them. One that is plainly wrong (garbled, or at the wrong line):
report it under Latin doubts as `side-note page.line`.

## Finish

1. `status: translated` in the front matter (nothing else changes there).
2. `.venv/bin/python scripts/w3/lint.py chunks/eucharistia/<your chunk>.md` until clean.
3. The four-class check above, sentence by sentence.
4. ⛔ Edit **only your chunk(s)**. No git, no other files. Everything shared goes in your report.

## Report (≤ 200 words per chunk, exactly these heads)

- **Chunk:** id, Latin words, notes.
- **Ledger rows:** in LEDGER.md's table format `| id | chunk / note | claim | status | how / next step |`.
- **Glossary proposals:** Latin · proposed English · where · why.
- **Latin doubts:** page.line · printed · suspicion · settled on the plate?

## Glossary (the 530 rows these chunks use; the full file is GLOSSARY.md)

# GLOSSARY — FROZEN 2026-09-28 (Wilson's pilot review)

*One Latin term, one English rendering, every time, across the whole corpus. A reader must be able
to recognise the same word coming back, because Wyclif's arguments turn on it. A rendering changes
only by a dated decision in CONVENTIONS' decision log, never silently in a chunk. Entries may be
*added* by recorded decision as new terms appear. **Tag keys:** a chunk tags a term as
`[English]{g:latin-form}` (CONVENTIONS §11), and the key must match a Latin form in one of the rows
below. These rows are also the source of the site's hover glossary. Where a term has two senses,
the entry says so and each chunk's note picks one. A term marked **CONTEXTUAL** holds together
senses English splits: its English is chosen by context, under the dikaiosune rule (CONVENTIONS §6).*

**Sources of the decisions.** "Pilot" = settled in `pilots/` this session. "T. p. N" = Mark
Thakkar, "Duces caecorum," *Vivarium* 58 (2020), page N (`reference/`), which documents the
errors of the two most recent translations. His corrections are adopted here unless an entry says
otherwise.

**Orthography.** Headwords are given in the Society editions' medieval spelling (*eciam*,
*racio*, *quiditas*, *ymmo*), because that is what the translator will meet on the page.

## A. The church

| Latin | English | Note |
|---|---|---|
| ecclesia | church | Lower-case in English except in a proper title. |
| ecclesia militans / triumphans / dormiens | the church militant / triumphant / sleeping | *Dormiens* = the souls in purgatory. Not "dormant". |
| pars peregrinans; peregrinari | the pilgrim part; to be a pilgrim | Augustine's *peregrinatio* (Ench. 56). Pilot. |
| predestinatus, -i | the predestinate (sg. "a predestinate [person]") | Never "the elect", which is *electi* and gets "the elect". |
| prescitus, -i | **the foreknown** | ⭐ Wyclif's technical term for those God foreknows will be damned. It is **not** "the reprobate" (*reprobi* → "the reprobate"). Explain it in a note at its first occurrence in **each work**. The English word misleads on its own and Penn explains it only once (T. p. 361 n. 12). Pilot. |
| via / patria | the way / the homeland | *Beatitudo patrie* → "the blessedness of the homeland". Pilot. The earthly sense (one's native country) is also "homeland"; a note where it matters (*Dial.* 54.2). |
| corpus Christi misticum | the mystical body of Christ | |
| mater nostra | our mother | Church as mother is the governing figure of *De ecclesia* I. |
| fides formata / informis | formed faith / unformed faith | Faith formed by charity. Pilot. |
| fides explicita / implicita | explicit faith / implicit faith | The scholastic pair (*Dial.* 28.16–17). Ruled 2026-09-28. |
| articulus fidei | article of faith | Ruled 2026-09-28 (4 sites). |
| infidelis | unbeliever; with a dative, faithless (to) | Two senses by construction. Pairs with *infidelitas*, unbelief. Ruled 2026-09-28 (10 sites). |
| Christicole | worshippers of Christ | Ruled 2026-09-28. |
| litere fraternitatum | letters of fraternity | Friars' letters admitting a benefactor to the order's suffrages. Ruled 2026-09-28 (4 sites). |
| canonizare | canonize | The same English whether pope or scripture canonizes (*Dial.* 20.31, 21.1). Ruled 2026-09-28 (6 sites). |
| capitaneus | captain | Kept apart from *caput* "head": Wyclif grants the pope captaincy and denies him headship. Ruled 2026-10-01 (*Eccl.* 17.13, 19.21–24, 22.8). |
| obedienciarius | one who obeys | Non-classical agent noun: the subject bound to obey (not the monastic officer). Ruled 2026-10-02 (*Eccl.* 39.3). |
| speculator | watchman | The bishop as watchman (Ezek. 3:17). Ruled 2026-10-02 (*Eccl.* 55.16). |
| ecclesiastici | CONTEXTUAL: clergy / those who belong to the church | Usually the clergy; where Wyclif means every member of the church (*Eccl.* 81.4) render "those who belong to the church" and write a **C** note. Ruled 2026-10-02. |
| ecclesia laycalis / secularis | the lay church / the secular church | Ruled 2026-10-02 (154.15, 156.3). |

# *De eucharistia*, chapter 5, part 5: [TITLE]

## ¶1 · 131.14–133.11

> [p. 131] Unde, ut loquuntur Ambrosius, Hugo et alii veritatis discipuli quod eadem essencia que prius fuit non sacramentum post fit sacramentum virtute verborum Christi, et sic quoad figuracionem convertitur in corpus Christi, ut loquitur Anshelmus, et sic substancia panis et vini non remanet in actu consideracionis ut prius, sicut philosophi loquuntur, ponentes sensibile et tempus poni in actu per sensacionem et intelleccionem. Non enim intellexit quod sit accidens sine subiecto, cum in De Veritate capitulo ultimo ita scribit: Existente namque corpore colorem eius esse necesse est, et pereunte corpore colorem eius manere inpossibile est. Quamvis enim illud dicat in persona discipuli, tamen consequenter illud approbat ponendo diversitatem inter colorem et eius subiectum ac rectitudinem et eius signum. Rectitudo enim non dependet ab illo signo, sicut color dependet [p. 132] ab subiecto. Quando enim Augustinus et alii sancti in suis dyalogis loquuntur ut discipuli et pretereunt ac non reprobant, indubie illud quod ponunt tanquam discipuli ut magistri approbant. Unde in confirmacionem istius sentencie allegavi Augustinum superius quod accidens non potest esse sine subiecto tam in dyalogo suo quam alibi. Docet enim racio naturalis quod non potest esse accidens sine subiecto, quia non potest esse subiectum sine suo accidente, ergo multo magis econtra; nam secundum omnes qui intelligunt se ipsos maius vel tantum foret vinculum ac dependencia accidentis ad subiectum quam econtra. Et argumentum patet ex hoc quod si aliqua creatura est, tunc est dependencia eius ad Deum; quod est relacio inseparabilis; et sic non potest esse substancia materialis sine quantitate continua et discreta, sine relacione suarum parcium ad omnem eius punctum, et sic de infinitis aliis accidentibus. Numquid credimus quod analogum accidentis sit prius naturaliter quam genus substancie quod est basis cuilibet accidenti, sic quod accidens potest esse per totum mundum sine substancia, non econtra? unde genus substancie dependeret a genere accidentis, non econtra; ymmo species substancie materialis dependeret a corpore de genere quantitatis, non econtra, cum conveniunt invicem, ut quantitas potest quantumlibet rarefieri et condensari, ut coguntur dicere in eukaristia. Et sic substancia potest mutari in quantitatem sine acquisicione vel deperdicione quantitatis, cum quantitas ita potest; et sic punctus posset in infinitum maiorari, cum sicut pedalitas per accidens est pedalitas, sic quantitas per accidens est quantitas. [p. 133] Sed longe aliter sentit Augustinus de quantitate, ut patet Vᵗᵒ de Trinitate IXᵒ et XIIIᵒ, sic loquitur: Sicut ergo non dicimus tres essencias, ita non dicimus tres magnitudines. In rebus, inquit, que participacione magnitudinis magne sunt, quibus aliud est esse, aliud magnum esse, sicut magna domus et magnus mons et magnus animus, in hiis ergo rebus aliud est magnitudo, aliud quod ab ea magnitudine magnum est, et prorsus non hoc est magnitudo quod magna domus, sed vera magnitudo in Deo est ipse Deus et non sibi accidens.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶2 · 133.12–135.2

> [p. 133] Ex istis patet loyca huius sancti qua utitur probando distinccionem accidencium. Et patet secundo, quod non vocat accidencia res que poterunt per se esse (ut dictum est capitulo IIIᵒ). Et patet tercio error eorum qui ponunt quantitatem primi generis creature non distingui a sua substancia. Error enim in materia de eukaristia precipitat eos profundius ad implicandum quamlibet substanciam esse Deum, quia indubie, si non sit distinccio inter magnitudinem materialis substancie et suam essenciam, tunc (ut Augustinus arguit) ipsa est Deus; et credo quod error quo colitur accidens tanquam Deus induxit in errores huiusmodi cecans multos in loyca et methaphisica; et hii sunt qui dicunt sacramentum altaris esse quantitatem que est tempus maius aut minus, ut unam hostiam dicunt esse momentum et aliam diem dominicum, sed terciam dicunt septimanam vel mensem, hii magnificant tantum suam scienciam quod dicunt se scire modo distincte qua hora erit finale iudicium; oportet enim ipsos dicere quod hoc sacramentum [p. 134] sit quantitas successiva. Statuunt enim sibi tanquam principium hoc porisma dyaboli: Si aliquod ens creatum sit distinctum a substancia, tunc ipsum poterit per se esse, et ex isto profundant se in erroribus infinitis, dicentes quod accidens non potest esse nisi accidens, sicut substancia non potest esse nisi substancia, quia aliter quidditas nature sibi accideret, verumptamen accidens intelligi potest dupliciter, scilicet neutraliter vel adiective; neutraliter intelligendo sacramentum altaris esse accidens sed non secundo modo, cum nulli accidit; nec Deus supplet vicem cause materialis in isto, licet omnis creatura accidentaliter inest Deo, sed remanet in accidente per se posito quedam naturalitas ad formaliter inherendum; et sic quedam accidentalitas qualis non potest inesse substancie. Sed consequencius dicerent ponendo inesse cuiuslibet forme substanciali quandam naturalitatem remotam obediencialem, sicut cuilibet forme accidentali inest quedam remota naturalitas obediencialis, ut inhereat materiali substancie; nam ille qui potest sic mutare naturas ut forma accidentalis per se existat et agat, nedum producendo formas accidentales sed formas substanciales quod videtur naturali esse proprium substancie: ille, inquam, potest facere formas substanciales materiis inherere, potissime cum potest actuaciones formarum remanencium omnino suspendere; quod est plus quam appetitus et actuaciones remittere vel mutare; ideo homo istius scole timeret sibi ne blaspheme neget potenciam infinitam absolute necessariam Dei sui; unde ego utor hac arte, non admitto tales casus insolitos timendo blasphemias, nisi probetur mihi hoc esse de Dei potencia; et hoc facto paratus sum ad concedendum probatum [p. 135] et infinitum excellenciora quam ipsi ponunt Deo et sacramento suo competere.

- 131.14: So with other doctors.
- 132.7: Natural reason teaches that accident cannot exist without subject.
- 133.15: Quantity must be distinguished from substance.
- 134.2: Errors caused by the attempt to make accidents self-existing.
- 134.30: It leads to denying God's power.

# *De eucharistia*, chapter 5, part 6: [TITLE]

## ¶1 · 135.3–136.11

> [p. 135] Unde videtur mihi, quod doctor Bonaventura et alii inconsequenter sompniant quod propter honorem sacramenti et devocionem populi multa sunt ponenda de eukaristia que non sunt fundabilia in scriptura; habeo autem pauca adversus eos qui inconsequenter et nimis parce sompniant. Quamvis autem sit de natura sompnii dormientis quod sit irregularis et expers racionis, tamen sompnium vigilis quod est ymaginacio sine fundamento debet habere evidenciam racionis; posset ergo fingi quod ex fundamento huius materie quod omnes vires anime humane tam organice quam non organice sint per se sine subiecto, et quod ille sint plene speciebus, actibus et virtutibus, ut anime beatorum erunt in patria, sic quod habeant plenitudinem beatitudinis consequentis. Sint ergo infinicies infinite qualitates huiusmodi ornate beatitudinis cum disposicionibus predictis que sint sine subiecto, et ponantur in qualibet parte proporcionali hostie infinite. Ille autem qui negat hunc casum habet negare fundamentum fabulancium tanquam conditores legis in ista materia; ymmo habita possibilitate casus non evidencius fundabit veritatem opinionis sue de inesse quam fundatur de facto in scriptura casus iam positus; cum ergo tunc foret hostia infinitum plus sacra quam modo defenditur, quare non datur ista sanctitas et honor hostie? Nam quelibet pars talis hostie haberet infinitos per se [p. 136] fines, gracia quorum totum genus humanum racionabiliter laboraret, et quodlibet istorum accidencium foret formaliter beatum haberetque actus beatos perpetuos, et sic foret melius homine misero, nec foret racio quare non posset elicere alios actus, sicut clare videt deitatem et gaudet nimirum gaudio magno. Tale, inquam, gloriosum accidens comederet corporaliter homo in assumendo viaticum, sicut comedit corpus Christi. Infinita sunt talia deliramenta infidelia quibus ex errore invento de eukaristia mendaciter et blaspheme occupatur ecclesia.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶2 · 136.12–137.6

> [p. 136] Et pro isto potest intelligi sentencia Augustini in De Verbis Domini Sermone XXVIIIᵒ dicentis: Dixi vobis quod ante verba Christi quod offertur panis dicatur, sed cum verba Christi deprompta fuerint, iam non panis dicitur sed corpus appellatur. Iste sanctus voluit quod illud quod prius fuit panis foret corpus Domini virtute sue benediccionis; ideo dicit Sermone LIIIᵒ loquens de eukaristia: Sacramentum quidem pene omnes corpus Christi dicunt. Non, inquam, intendit sanctus panem destrui vel in essencia non manere, ut patet ex dictis, sicut homine facto papa et nomine novo imposito, non propterea nomen perditur, quod ad naturalem proprietatem rei consequitur sed sopitur. Nec dubium quin equivocant in predicacione tropica, vocando illum panem corpus Christi modo quo exponit se ipsum Sermone XLVIIIᵒ, notans quomodo Christus nunc dicitur esse in similitudinem carnis peccati et nunc dicitur peccatum. Solet, inquit, similitudo capere nomen rei cuius est similitudo, ut [p. 137] exemplificat de homine picto quod est evidencius de sacramento altaris. Intencio ergo sanctorum est quod in presencia corporis Christi consideracio nature hostie suspenditur et tota intencio sequendi Christum in moribus attendatur, cum natura docet nos consideracionem luminis astrorum diffugere in solis presencia.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶3 · 137.7–138.4

> [p. 137] Quarto replicatur per hoc quod multi sancti moriebantur in ista fide; difficile ergo et inopinabile foret impugnare istam fidem vel sanctos illos accusare qui scripserant et defenderant illam fidem. Scribit enim sanctus Thomas super IVᵒ, distinccione XIᵃ, articulo primo: Hec, inquit, posicio que ponit substanciam panis remanere simul cum corpore Christi est incompetens, inpossibilis et heretica. Incompetens quidem, quia impediret veneracionem debitam huic sacramento. Esset enim ydolatrie occasio, si substancia panis ibi remaneret. Esset eciam contra significacionem sacramenti, quia species que inducerent in verum corpus Christi significarent magis substanciam panis. Esset tercio contraria huic sacramento, quia cibus iste non esset pure spiritualis sed eciam corporalis. Et quod sit inpossibilis, patet quia inpossibile est aliquid esse nunc, ubi prius non fuit nisi ipso mutato vel alio in ipsum converso; non enim posset eciam per miraculum fieri quod esset animal racionale, mortale et non esset homo; sic ergo corpus Christi non posset aliter se habere nunc quam prius, nisi interveniat mutacio; cum ergo ex parte panis non [p. 138] foret mutacio, nec ex parte corporis Christi, quia sic idem corpus moveretur simul et semel ad diversa loca, quod est inpossibile, cum tunc motus contrarii inessent simul eidem.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶4 · 138.5–138.8

> [p. 138] Quod autem sit heretica, patet ex hoc quod contradicit veritati scripture. Non enim esset verum dicere: Hoc est corpus meum, sed hic est corpus meum.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶5 · 138.9–138.21

> [p. 138] Hic dicitur quod petitur assumptum, ut puta quod sanctus Thomas moriebatur in ista fide vel alius assignandus, quia nescitur qualem instinctum habuerunt in exitu, et sicut fabule laborant quod servaverunt hoc usque ad mortem, ita laborant fabule non minus probabiles, quod coram populo in mortis articulo retractarunt, quia aliter iuxta istam stulticiam dampnaretur sanctus Origenes cui imponitur ut impio heretico defendisse et in scriptis reliquisse quod nemo dampnabitur perpetuo sed ad tempus; ille autem qui sine revelacione asserit quod tam pius et tam sanctus sicut fuit hic Origenes sit dampnatus est stulto stulcior.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶6 · 138.22–138.28

> [p. 138] Iterum, inter beatos Augustinum et Jeronimum fuit contrarietas de fide scripture Gal. IIᵒ utrum Petrus peccavit in simulando communicare cum gentibus; et licet non habeamus exceptis fabulis quod alter eorum revocavit errorem quem reliquit in sua epistola, tamen stultum est credere quod alter eorum propterea sit dampnatus.

## ¶7 · 138.29–139.8

> [p. 138] Iterum tercio, inter beatum Bernhardum et alios in hoc sibi contrarios fuit repugnancia si beata virgo fuit concepta in originali peccato, sicut usque hodie [p. 139] est inter magnas sectas in isto contrarietas. Et tamen licet hoc expressius tangit fidem scripture quam remanencia panis post consecracionem, dementis est dicere quod propterea altera istarum sectarum est heretica et dampnanda. Cum ergo fides scripture cum rectitudine vite sit evidencia ad topice iudicandum, patet quod stultum est sine revelacione ista de quoquam asserere.

> [p. 139] Et quantum ad illud allegatum de sancto Thoma, dicitur a multis quod pseudofratres post mortem eius corruperant ut plurimum eius scripta et hoc ideo, quia procurarunt esse inquisitores pravitatis heretice propter lucrum; ideo ut habeant laqueos plus subdolos ad involvendum simplices, quorum bona avare siciunt, seminarunt nimis spisse zizania contra fidem scripture; sed benedictus Dominus regnum nostrum liberatum est ab ista inquisicione heretice pravitatis, cum multi tam seculares quam religiosi sint longe subtiliores et sufficienciores ad inquirendum in regno nostro vel ubilibet, specialiter in materia de eukaristia, hereticam pravitatem. Cuius evidencia est quod defecerunt in ista materia, primo in visione corporis Christi in sacramento oculo corporali, secundo in materia de impanacione, sed in tercio signo magis defecerant.

## Loserth's side-notes (PD, verbatim; not our translation)

- 135.3: The supporters of the independence of accidents do not carry their theory far enough.
- 136.12: Augustine, when he says that bread has become the Body, means that we are to think of it as such.
- 137.7: It is said that saints have died in this faith; e. g. St. Thomas.
- 138.8: We have no proof that they did die in it; nor, if they did, is such an error necessarily a cause of damnation.
- 139.12: The writings of St. Thomas are said to have been falsified after his death, in the interest of friar-inquisitors.

# *De eucharistia*, chapter 5, part 7: [TITLE]

## ¶1 · 139.29–140.8

> [p. 139] Unde istud scandalum fabricatum super scripto sancti Thome fuit statim, quia tempore Doctoris Subtilis, fabricatum mendaciter et destructum; ideo absit a fideli credere quod omnes contrarii isti sentencie [p. 140] sancto Thome imposite sunt fedati heretica pravitate, quia tamen receperunt istum ordinem sanctum et pium, quamvis habeant Scarioth inter illos. Suppono sanctum Thomam errasse secundum formam que fingitur et respondeo ad argucias per ordinem, ne devoti et scioli illius ordinis vel alii occasionaliter seducantur; unum tamen scio quod iste sagitte plumbee nunquam processerant de pharetra sanctitatis.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶2 · 140.9–140.17

> [p. 140] Quantum ad primam solucionem trimembrem patet quod est temeraria, non probata. Est, inquam, temeraria, quia ponit ut articulum fidei quod nec panis nec vinum post consecracionem remaneant; quod est nimis temerarium propter multa; nam in nullo articulo triplicis fidei ecclesie est iste articulus declaratus; quis ergo color quod propter assercionem unius temerariam sit ecclesia novo articulo fidei gravidanda?

[ENGLISH]

## ¶3 · 140.18–141.10

> [p. 140] Iterum, scriptura sacra et antiqui sancti doctores ut Ambrosius, Augustinus et alii autores canonum dicunt regulariter quod hostia consecrata est panis et nunquam dicunt quod est accidens. Que ergo foret presumpcio sollempnisare hoc sine auctoritate ut fidem katholicam? sicut decretum Romane ecclesie tempore Nicholai IIⁱ decrevit quod post consecracionem panis et vinum remaneant (ut patet superius) et concordat plene decretum Ambrosii, ibidem, Omnia quecunque, et breviter quotcunque ponit quod panis erit post consecracionem corpus Domini; cum ergo [p. 141] illud decretum fuit diu ante Innocencium IIIᵘᵐ (ut patet per Cestrensem libro VIIᵒ), videtur quod ecclesia diu viavit in floribus fidei sine ista ficticia (non enim est evidens quod papa Nicolaus IIᵘˢ et tota sua ecclesia cum sanctis doctoribus qui nunquam sciverunt vel recoluerunt istam ficticiam sed asseruerunt tamquam per se notum eius contrarium, ut patet per beatum Augustinum superius allegatum de accidentibus) sic dampnata; nimis ceca itaque foret temeritas hereticare in hoc sanctos cum primitiva ecclesia.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶4 · 141.11–142.21

> [p. 141] Ex quo videtur ulterius probabiliter supponendum quod ecclesia tempore Innocencii tercii loquens de transsubstanciacione locuta est de illa ad sensum famosorum doctorum, quo usa fuit ecclesia primitiva. Videtur enim Hugo loqui de transsubstanciacione panis ad sensum quo utitur Ambrosius de conversione in corpus Christi. Transitus autem ille vel illa conversio non potest salvari nisi ad illum sensum quo concedunt quod panis fit, erit et est corpus Christi, hoc est, post consecracionem figurat sacramentaliter corpus Christi. Hoc enim est maius miraculum, quam foret conversio de qua fit mencio in lege veteri, ymmo quam foret conversio desinente panis substancia, quia utrobique est corpus Christi eque vere et realiter ibi presens; et super hec tolluntur inconveniencia que ponit panis destruccio. Laudabilis ergo foret mutacio que ponit tot et plura bona et evacuat magis mala. Nec scio aliter concordare decretalem Innocencii et decretum. Non enim est racionabile quod decretalis sit immemor decreti prioris aut quod hereticet priorem ecclesiam sine causa. Unde patet [p. 142] quod stat cum isto sensu quod post istam transsubstanciacionem panis transsubstanciatus remaneat, verumptamen diffido quod ecclesia Avinonica cum suis satrapis significacionem istam acciperet. Sed que cura de hoc, cum prior ecclesia hoc approbans fuit gravior, sicut gravior fuit persona Innocencii tercii cum pluribus quam mille prelatis licet non episcopis sed abbatibus ydiotis quam ecclesia Gregorii IXⁱ cum satrapis secte sue? Ab illo namque dicitur quinque libros decretalium capere auctoritatem novam, priori sopita, sicut Machomet dicit legem suam. ab ipso capere auctoritatem non a lege nova vel veteri. Sic inquam decretales epistole ex multis antiquis edicionibus decretalium prioris ecclesie sunt collecte dimissis partibus verioribus aut displicentibus et novis sive placentibus acceptatis; ideo est novum opus paris auctoritatis cum aliis epistolis pape de novo editis, quia aliter caperent iste ultime decretales ex multitudine paparum priorum longe maiorem auctoritatem quam evangelium. Nam prima epistola decretalis secundum ipsos est paris auctoritatis cum evangelio.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶5 · 142.22–142.26

> [p. 142] Ex quo videtur magnum esse peccatum ab ipsa aliquid abrogare. Sic ergo videtur et libros decretalium paris esse auctoritatis cum nudis epistolis pape et cardinalium quorum auctoritatem excedit sinodus facta per Nicholaum II.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶6 · 142.27–143.3

> [p. 142] Quantum ad illud trimembre argumentum quo suadetur incompetencia huius sentencie, patet ad primum quo dicitur quod hoc posicio impedit veneracionem debitam huic sacramento, patet quod falsum assumitur, sed nititur destruere ydolatriam qua nimis multi colunt corpus mathematicum false [p. 143] fictum per se existere tanquam Deum, et sic nititur cultum erroneum signo exhibitum destruere et totum cultum Christo quem fide ibi videmus colligere.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶7 · 143.4–143.26

> [p. 143] Et quantum ad occasionem ydolatrie, dictum est superius quomodo Doctor Subtilis destruit hanc evidenciam usque ad fundamentum in ea; nam ita pronus est populus ad colendum hoc sacramentum quod ista via ponit inpossibiliter corpus de genere quantitatis, sicut est pronus colere panem illum ut corpus Christi quod foret ex maiori similitudine minus inconveniens in natura. Et preterea per hoc quod nominatur panis foret populus pronior ex naturali ingenio ad cognoscendum quod non est corpus Christi. Adversarii enim infideliter abscondunt naturalem quidditatem sacramenti sic quod populus non cognoscit distinccionem eius a corpore Christi, in tantum quod ista secta verecundatur detegere suam ficticiam. Unde conveniencius fantasiaret ponendo quod sacramentum non est nisi species vel similitudo rei qualis est in speculo vel medio quam ponendo unam talem rem insolidam ut panis sine subiecto, cum magnus doctor Augustinus ponit philosophice quod illa terna dimensio non potest esse sine subiecto. Ex ista sentencia efficaciter tolleretur falsus cultus ydolatrandi, quo signum vel ymago vel accidens peius ymagine colitur tamquam Deus; sed donate istam iniuriam.

[ENGLISH]

## Loserth's side-notes (PD, verbatim; not our translation)

- 140.9: To insist on the cessation of the bread is to add a new article to the creed.
- 140.18: The great saints, Ambrose &c. never call the host an accident; are they to be damned as heretics?
- 141.11: Therefore as to Innocent's decretal, we must suppose that it follows the sense of the primitive church.
- 142.27: 1. We would not lessen devotion to the Sacrament, but would prevent men from worshipping a mathematical figure.
- 143.4: The use of the word 'bread' would teach people not to worship the matter of the Sacrament.
