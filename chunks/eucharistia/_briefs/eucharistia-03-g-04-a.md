# Translation brief: eucharistia 03-g–04-a

You translate these 3 chunk(s) of Wyclif's *Tractatus de eucharistia* in a single pass. Everything you need is in this file:
the working card, the glossary rows these chunks use, and for each chunk its scaffold and the editor's
apparatus for its pages. Work so as to use few tool calls:

1. Read this brief once (it is the only file you need to read, unless the card names one for your chunk).
2. For each chunk, write the COMPLETE chunk file ONCE with the Write tool to its path (given in the chunk's
   header below): the scaffold with `status: translated`, the title, the English after every Latin block,
   headings and side-notes as the card says, Notes, and Transcription notes, in the card's
   layout. Never alter the Latin. Do not make a series of small edits.
3. Use the apparatus given here for variants (the card's rule: a variant that gives the sense is translated
   with a T note citing the siglum; otherwise translate the print and flag it). Open a plate image only if a
   word cannot be construed at all from the print plus the apparatus; otherwise flag it as a Latin doubt.
4. Scripture: quote the Douay-Rheims as you know it. At the END, check every reference you quoted in ONE
   command: `cd /Users/wilsonpruitt/wyclif && .venv/bin/python scripts/w3/bible.py "Ref 1" "Ref 2" ...` and fix any wording
   that differs, in the same chunk file (this is the one allowed round of edits).
5. Run `cd /Users/wilsonpruitt/wyclif && .venv/bin/python scripts/w3/lint.py chunks/eucharistia/wyc-eucharistia-03-g.md chunks/eucharistia/wyc-eucharistia-03-h.md chunks/eucharistia/wyc-eucharistia-04-a.md` once and fix what it reports.
6. Final message: per chunk, the ledger rows (table: id | chunk / note | claim | status | how / next step),
   glossary proposals, Latin doubts, and a one-line note of anything the coordinator must decide.

Standing rules (from the *De ecclesia* briefs, 2026-10-02):
- Do NOT search the Patrologia or other sources; a separate checker verifies them afterwards. Give the
  editor's reference, the modern form in the English, and "to be checked" with a fresh LEDGER id per item
  (never reuse an id).
- Notes open with their bold class codes, `**S/C.**`, never bare letters mid-note. No process words in
  the notes ("the report", "the coordinator", "brief").
- OCR scars (stray English or margin letters, line numbers read as words, glued or broken words,
  numerals read as letters) stay out of the chunk: translate the print's word and list each scar in your
  final message only (page.line, token, likely print reading). The coordinator fixes the Latin.
- Flag every place the established Latin may have LOST a word (it does not construe, especially at a page
  head or foot) or DOUBLED one: page.line and the suspicion. Translate the print as it stands; supply a
  missing word only in brackets with a T note. The editor's print governs; list any departure.


## The working card

# TRANSLATOR CARD — one *De eucharistia* chunk

This card replaces reading CONVENTIONS, the pilot and Thakkar in full: it is their working core.
Adapted from `chunks/potestate-pape/CARD.md` (Loserth's other volume) with the B+ lessons of
`chunks/incarnacione/CARD.md` (2026-11-06; **reviewed 2026-11-06** on `prol-a`: `_review/REVIEW-prol-a.md`). Read it, then `GLOSSARY.md`,
then your scaffold (or your brief, which carries all three). Consult CONVENTIONS.md only when the card sends
you there. Work in `~/wyclif`. Wyclif is approached with **daggers drawn**: the most recent English
versions were "worse than useless" because of four error classes (below). Your English must survive
a hostile reader with the Latin open.

## Work lean (cost is per tool call: each call re-sends your whole context)

1. One call reading what you need (the brief, or CARD + GLOSSARY + scaffold).
2. **One** `bible.py` call with every scripture reference you need (it takes many refs).
3. Plates **only** for a Latin doubt the print plus apparatus cannot settle.
4. Write each finished chunk in **one** Write of the whole file (Latin blocks copied unchanged).
5. Lint once; fix; done. Draft in your head, not in the file.

## The volume

*Tractatus de eucharistia* and *Tractatus de penitencia sive de confessione*, ed. Johann Loserth (Wyclif
Society, 1892), from the plates of archive.org `latinworks13wycl` (**leaf = page + 71**; leaf images in
`text/eucharistia/raw/leaves/`). Three texts:

Chunk ids: `prol-a … prol-c` the compendium, `01-a … 09-n` the nine chapters, `pen01 … pen06` *De
penitencia*, `quest` the *Questio*.

- **pp. 1–10, the compendium** (*Sentencia tractatus de Eukaristia in compendio*, under "Prologus"): a
  medieval summary of the nine chapters that came down with the work. Translate it like the text.
- **pp. 11–326, the *Tractatus de eucharistia* (maior)**, nine long chapters. Written in Wyclif's last
  years, before 1382–83 (Loserth, Introd. §4: it shares passages word for word with *Sermones* III, and
  it avoids the words *substancia* and *materialis* of the bread, which Wyclif says in *Sermo* III.54 he
  has stopped using). Wyclif's case against the "modern" doctrine: that the consecrated host is in its
  nature bread and wine and sacramentally, figuratively, the body and blood of Christ; that an accident
  without a subject is impossible; that the decree *Ego Berengarius* (*De cons.* D. 2 c. 42) is the
  faith of the ancient Roman church; against the friars, Thomas, Scotus and "the sect of the signs".
  A **treatise**: Wyclif speaks in the first person, states conclusions, raises objections and answers
  them. The tractatus minor (the *Confessio*) is NOT in this volume (Shirley, *Fasc. Ziz.*).
- **pp. 327–348, *De eucharistia et penitencia sive de confessione*** in six chapters (only ch. 1 is on
  the eucharist; the rest is penance and auricular confession), then the short ***Questio ad fratres de
  sacramento altaris*** (pp. 347–348, its first part only: Loserth notes that the rest of the
  manuscript's text is not on the sacrament, and is Hus's).

**Sigla. ⚠ They differ between the two works.** *De eucharistia* (Introd. §5): **A** Vienna 3927;
**B** Vienna 3932; **C** Vienna 1387 ("the best of the three" Vienna MSS, correcting A and B); **D** Prague
Univ. IV D 22 (1404–05, Andreas of Kouřim); **E** Prague Univ. XI E 3 (1460; Loserth: "the best and most
reliable text of all the five"). Loserth's lettering "does not in any way refer to their respective
value". The Vienna MSS are one group, the Prague MSS another. *De penitencia* (Introd. §6): **A** Vienna
3927; **B** Bautzen, Gersdorf Library M. St. 80.7; **C** Vienna 1337; **D** Prague Univ. III G 11; **E**
Vienna 3980; **F** Vienna 4527. Cite variants with the sigla of the work you are in. Marginal notes in the
manuscripts that Loserth prints ("F in marg.", "DB in marg.") are reception: an **R** note where they
show how a reader took the text.

**The page foot** (in your brief as "apparatus", by page) has two blocks, both keyed to the **line**:
the variants (`19. C: ecclesie in marg. alia manu.`) and Loserth's source references. The OCR of it is
rough: read it for sense, not letter by letter, and read the plate foot where a variant matters.

## The job

The Latin in your scaffold is **established and frozen** (blind transcription of the plates, checked word
by word against a four-scan vote; residue read on the plate). Fill `[TITLE]` (short, lower case: "the
three opinions on the quiddity of the host"), each `[ENGLISH]`, the notes and the transcription notes;
set `status: translated`; lint; report.

- **Headings:** keep `## ¶k · range` exactly. **Never change a range; never split a paragraph.**
- **Never alter the Latin.** A transcription error you find (a stray mark, a broken word, a side-note
  word in the text) is REPORTED, never repaired in your file: the coordinator repairs the transcription
  (`text/eucharistia/bt/pNNN.txt`) and refreshes the chunk's Latin. A word that looks wrong: read the
  apparatus for that line first; then, if still doubtful, the plate (`text/eucharistia/raw/leaves/nLEAF.jpg`,
  LEAF = page + 71 padded to four digits: p. 1 = `n0072.jpg`). A variant that gives the sense → translate
  it + **T** note citing the siglum; a compelling emendation → translate it + **T** note "(our
  emendation)"; neither → translate the print and flag it. Never smooth nonsense into sense. Report every
  such case. **Loserth's printed text governs** (ruled 2026-10-02 for Loserth's volumes; the
  manuscripts-outrank-the-print rule is Harris's volumes only): translate it, his own emendations
  included, unless it will not construe; a manuscript reading is chosen only then, or where the source
  Wyclif quotes, read this session, agrees with it. Every departure gets a T note giving both readings.
- **The compendia (`prol-a … prol-c`) summarise chapters whose Latin is already established** in this
  directory. Where the compendium's ellipsis leaves a construal open (whose argument, which *per* phrase is a
  ground and which a means), grep the chapter's `>` blocks, follow them, and cite the page in the **C** note:
  that is construal, not source verification, and one call. (`prol-a` 2.1–5: the three decrees are the
  objections' grounds, ch. 1 pp. 24, 25, 28.)
- **English layout:** `[N]` at the same word as `[p. N]` in the Latin (the chunk's first `[p. N]` is
  implicit). Supplied words in `[brackets]`, sparingly, ⛔ never in italics. **Quotations** in quotation
  marks. Your brief carries Loserth's **italic runs** per page where the scan's OCR gives them (rough;
  ⚠ page numbers drift: a run not in your page's Latin belongs to a neighbouring page): they are
  the editor's judgement of where a quotation runs, not the manuscript's: follow them by default, depart
  where the source shows otherwise (say so in a note). Reviews do not check quotation bounds against the
  italics. Italicised scripture inside indirect speech is quoted too; where quoting would garble the
  sentence, leave it unquoted and give the reference in an **S** note.
- **Ordinals:** a degree-sign ordinal can print or OCR like a two-digit number (*30 et 10* = 3° and 1°).
  Read both forms the same way, and check the plate when a citation looks impossible.
- **Formulae of the disputation** (ruled 2026-10-01; fixed renderings, tagged only where GLOSSARY has a
  row): *instatur* "it is objected" · *obicitur* "it is objected" · *arguitur* "it is argued" (with
  *per*: GLOSSARY) · *dicitur* "it is said" (in an answer: "the answer is") · *respondetur* "the reply is"
  · *conclusio* "conclusion" · *antecedens / consequens* "antecedent / consequent" · *consequencia*
  "inference", ⛔ never "consequence" · *patet* "it is clear" · *supponitur* "it is supposed" ·
  *probatur* "proof:" or "it is proved" · *confirmatur* "this is confirmed" · *solvit / dissolvit* (an objection) "resolves", both (never "answers", which belongs to *respondetur / dicitur*).
- **A source note says only what the Latin says about the source** (who narrates, which book, which work)
  and leaves the rest to the ledger: never supply a story the Latin rules out (*narratum a beato Gregorio*:
  Gregory narrates).
- **Citation formulae:** *ubi supra* "in the place cited above" (⛔ never a claim about where a passage
  stands), *ut supra* "as above", *infra* "below". *Utrobique* "on both sides / in both places".

## The four error classes (Thakkar) — check every sentence

1. **Terms:** GLOSSARY.md governs, one term one rendering. Tag the **first occurrence in the chunk** of
   every §A–C term: `[accident]{g:accidens}`; a multi-word key is lower case with hyphens, `{g:corpus-christi}`, `{g:a-simili}` (lint rejects spaces). The key must exist in GLOSSARY.md. A term that looks
   technical but has no row: render it sensibly, untagged, and propose it in your report.
   **CONTEXTUAL** rows hold two senses English splits: choose by context and write a **C** note at the
   first occurrence in the chunk and wherever it leans to the other sense (the dikaiosune rule,
   CONVENTIONS §6).
   Rows that already exist and bear on this volume: *accidens* "accident" · *accidens absolutum*
   "absolute accident" · *transsubstanciacio* "transubstantiation" · *conficere* "consecrate (the
   eucharist)" · *figura / figuratum* "figure / thing figured" · *res sacramenti* "reality of the
   sacrament" · *sacramentalia* "sacramentals" · *quantus* "quantified" · *per se / per accidens* "of
   itself / by accident" · *sensibile commune* "common sensible" · *ecclesia* church (**lower-case**) ·
   *caritas* charity · *sentencia* teaching (and *sentencia verborum* "sense", a separate row) · *ex fide* as faith teaches ·
   *opinio* opinion · *novelli* the newer [doctors] · *sancti* the saints · *concludere* infer ("conclude" only where a
   conclusion is literally drawn) · *deduccio* deduction · *maneries* kind · *principaliter* as a main head ·
   *sensibilis* perceptible · *declarare / ostendere* make clear / show · *ecclesia* is tagged at its first
   occurrence in every chunk.
   **This volume's vocabulary is now ruled (2026-11-06, `prol-a` review):** *sacramentum* (the eucharist) ·
   *hostia* host · *panis / vinum* bread / wine · *calix* chalice · *corpus Christi / Domini* kept apart ·
   *remanencia* the remaining · *accidens sine subiecto* · *substancia · quantitas · qualitas* · *esse /
   esse sacramentale* being / sacramental being · *esus / manducacio* eating · *confeccio* consecration ·
   *secta signorum* · *novella / antiqua ecclesia* · *predicacio ydemptica / tropica* identical / tropical
   predication. **The mode adverbs, one word each, never merged, each tagged at first occurrence:**
   *sacramentaliter* sacramentally · *realiter* really (never "actually") · *vere* truly (never "really") ·
   *spiritualiter* spiritually · *virtualiter* virtually · *figurative* figuratively · *tropice* tropically ·
   *ydemptice* identically · *invisibiliter* invisibly · *sensibiliter* perceptibly · *corporaliter* bodily ·
   *substancialiter* substantially · *dimensionaliter* dimensionally. A term still missing a row (*ydemptificacio*,
   *conversio*, *fractio*, *confessio auricularis*, *absolucio*, *claves* …): render it sensibly, untagged, and
   propose it. *Ego Berengarius* stays as the decree's title (Wyclif's spelling *Beringarius* in the Latin;
   "Berengar" for the man in the English). In ch. 1, *res sacramenti* "reality of the sacrament" is a ruled
   row: the compendium's *de rebus huius sacramenti* (1.3) is the three-membered distinction the chapter sets
   out, so keep its *res* consistent with that row.
2. **Connectives carry the argument.** ⛔ Never omit one, never turn one into filler.

   | Latin | English | Never |
   |---|---|---|
   | enim, nam | for | "now", "indeed" |
   | ergo, igitur, ideo | therefore, so, then | "now", "and", "indeed" |
   | sed / autem, marking the **minor premiss or next step** | now | (omitted) |
   | sed / autem, adversative | but | (omitted) |
   | autem, continuative | and | (omitted), and **not "now"** |
   | cum (concessive / causal) | although / since | "whenever" |
   | tamen | yet, nevertheless | "therefore" |
   | item | again, also | "now" |
   | vero (continuative) | and; but (adversative) | "now", "truly" |
   | verumtamen | nevertheless | "but truly" |
   | unde | hence, so | "whence" (archaic), "where" |
   | per idem | by the same token | "in the same way" |
   | ymmo | indeed, rather (correcting upward) | (omitted) |
   | patet; constat | it is clear; it is evident | |

   "Now" is reserved for the minor premiss, or the step that brings a new premiss to bear. An *autem*
   that only extends the same step is "and". ⚠ The commonest error in *De ecclesia* (close-out, ~50 of
   69 connective fixes): a *sed* that brings the minor premiss of a syllogism closed by *ergo / ideo /
   igitur* rendered "but". Before writing "but" for a *sed*, look ahead for the *ergo*: if one follows,
   it is "now".
3. **Ordinary words with a medieval sense:** GLOSSARY §D; look up any word whose classical and
   Wyclifite senses may differ, and propose additions.
4. **Syntax:** construe before rendering (main verb, subject, what every relative and genitive hangs
   on). Keep quantifier order where it is meaning. Keep Wyclif's long periods where English tolerates
   them. **A doubtful construal is never chosen silently:** translate the likelier reading and write a
   **C** note giving the alternative.
   ⚠ **Predication is the matter here, as in *De incarnacione*.** *Hoc est corpus meum*, *panis est
   corpus Christi*, *hoc sacramentum est panis*: Wyclif argues about what the pronoun demonstrates and
   in what mode the predicate holds. Keep subject and predicate in his order, keep *est* as "is" (never
   "exists", "becomes" or "represents" unless the Latin says so), and keep the mode adverb where he puts
   it (*est sacramentaliter corpus Christi* "is sacramentally the body of Christ"). ⛔ Never soften "is"
   into "signifies" or harden "figuratively" into "really": the difference is the treatise's matter.
   Demonstrative pronouns (*hoc*, *istud*) under discussion: render "this", and keep their gender
   visible in a C note where the argument turns on it (*hoc* neuter against *hic*, 348).
   **Propositions in indirect speech** whose sense is under discussion: render as the quoted proposition
   ("who say 'this is an accident without a subject'"), not "who say that …", which asserts it.

## Scripture

`python3 scripts/w3/bible.py "I Cor 10:16"` (Vulgate + Douay–Rheims; psalms in Vulgate numbering) or
`python3 scripts/w3/bible.py --find "panis quem frangimus"`. Where Wyclif's Latin agrees with the
Clementine Vulgate, use the **Douay–Rheims wording**. Where he departs, translate *his* Latin and write
an **S** note giving the Vulgate. Modern references in the English (1 Cor. 10:16). The chapter numbers
are Wyclif's, the verse numbers Loserth's (the headnote says so once).

## Notes

- `[^n]` from 1, the marker placed in the same edit as its note, each opening with a type letter **with a
  full stop** (`**C.**`; the site strips only that form): **T** text · **C** construal · **G** glossary
  (passage-specific only; otherwise a tag) · **S** source · **R** reception/context (a manuscript's
  marginal note Loserth prints; Hus's or the Hussites' reuse where Loserth notes it). A note that does two
  jobs takes the combined code (`**S/T.**`, `**C/S.**`; lint accepts it). The first occurrence of a CONTEXTUAL
  row in each chunk (*sentencia*, *inconveniens*) always gets its **C** note.
- **Density: about one note per 70–100 Latin words**, fewer where the text is plain. Short, factual,
  says what the Latin does and stops. No modern theology, no evaluation, ⛔ no judgement on whose
  eucharistic doctrine is right.
- **Every identification** other than scripture checked with bible.py gets a ledger row in your report
  with a status: `editor` (Loserth's source reference at the page foot), `to-verify` (from memory: every
  patristic, scholastic or canon-law identification you did not read in this session), `verified` (you
  read the source text this session: say where; local PL at `~/patrologia/sources/pl/tei/`). ⛔ Never
  pass memory off as verified. Id `K<chunk>-<n>` (`K01a-1`; ⚠ `K`, since `E` is *De ecclesia*, `P`
  *De potestate pape*, `I` *De incarnacione*), cited in the note: "(LEDGER K01a-1)". Loserth's references
  to the *Corpus iuris canonici* are `editor`; give them in modern form (*De cons.* D. 2 c. 42) and say
  the form is ours. Expect above all: Gratian *De consecratione* D. 2 (*Ego Berengarius*, c. 42;
  Augustine and Ambrose there), Augustine (*In Ioh.*, *De civ. Dei*, sermons), Ambrose *De sacramentis*
  and *De mysteriis*, Hilary, Jerome, Bernard, Thomas (*ST* III qq. 73–83; *In IV Sent.*), Scotus,
  the Lombard *Sent.* IV d. 8–13, Grosseteste.

## Model of register

`pilots/wyc-ecclesia-01a.md` (De ecclesia pp. 1–5) is a reviewed model of register and note style: read
it for that only (it predates some GLOSSARY rulings; **GLOSSARY governs**). **The first chunk, `prol-a`** (the compendium), carries
the `## Headnote` for the whole volume; `pen01` carries a short headnote for *De penitencia* and `quest` one for the
*Questio* (date, sigla, Loserth's remarks on the text). The headnote ⛔ is **not** the card's thesis paragraph: "The move" is how the compendium *builds* the case, chapter by chapter, and names no adversary the chunk does not name; the date is given as Loserth's evidence plus the modern dating, each `[verify]`. The headnote (CONVENTIONS §12 order: occasion, text, the work's move, where it is answered; date,
editor, the two works and their sigla, the compendium, the *Questio*), each unverified claim marked
`[verify]`.

## Transcription notes

The variant list is either complete against the page-foot apparatus or headed "selected"; none that affects the
English may be left out. Plate readings and fixes to the Latin (stray stops that were ink flecks) are recorded
there.

## Side-notes

Already read against the plates (WORKFLOW 5, `text/eucharistia/sidenotes.fixed.tsv`) and placed in your
scaffold's section. ⛔ Do not edit them. One that is plainly wrong (garbled, or at the wrong line):
report it under Latin doubts as `side-note page.line`.

## Finish

1. `status: translated` in the front matter (nothing else changes there).
2. `.venv/bin/python scripts/w3/lint.py chunks/eucharistia/<your chunk>.md` until clean.
3. The four-class check above, sentence by sentence.
4. ⛔ Edit **only your chunk(s)**. No git, no other files. Everything shared goes in your report.

## Report (≤ 200 words per chunk, exactly these heads)

- **Chunk:** id, Latin words, notes.
- **Ledger rows:** in LEDGER.md's table format `| id | chunk / note | claim | status | how / next step |`.
- **Glossary proposals:** Latin · proposed English · where · why.
- **Latin doubts:** page.line · printed · suspicion · settled on the plate?

## Glossary (the 450 rows these chunks use; the full file is GLOSSARY.md)

# GLOSSARY — FROZEN 2026-09-28 (Wilson's pilot review)

*One Latin term, one English rendering, every time, across the whole corpus. A reader must be able
to recognise the same word coming back, because Wyclif's arguments turn on it. A rendering changes
only by a dated decision in CONVENTIONS' decision log, never silently in a chunk. Entries may be
*added* by recorded decision as new terms appear. **Tag keys:** a chunk tags a term as
`[English]{g:latin-form}` (CONVENTIONS §11), and the key must match a Latin form in one of the rows
below. These rows are also the source of the site's hover glossary. Where a term has two senses,
the entry says so and each chunk's note picks one. A term marked **CONTEXTUAL** holds together
senses English splits: its English is chosen by context, under the dikaiosune rule (CONVENTIONS §6).*

**Sources of the decisions.** "Pilot" = settled in `pilots/` this session. "T. p. N" = Mark
Thakkar, "Duces caecorum," *Vivarium* 58 (2020), page N (`reference/`), which documents the
errors of the two most recent translations. His corrections are adopted here unless an entry says
otherwise.

**Orthography.** Headwords are given in the Society editions' medieval spelling (*eciam*,
*racio*, *quiditas*, *ymmo*), because that is what the translator will meet on the page.

## A. The church

| Latin | English | Note |
|---|---|---|
| ecclesia | church | Lower-case in English except in a proper title. |
| ecclesia militans / triumphans / dormiens | the church militant / triumphant / sleeping | *Dormiens* = the souls in purgatory. Not "dormant". |
| pars peregrinans; peregrinari | the pilgrim part; to be a pilgrim | Augustine's *peregrinatio* (Ench. 56). Pilot. |
| predestinatus, -i | the predestinate (sg. "a predestinate [person]") | Never "the elect", which is *electi* and gets "the elect". |
| prescitus, -i | **the foreknown** | ⭐ Wyclif's technical term for those God foreknows will be damned. It is **not** "the reprobate" (*reprobi* → "the reprobate"). Explain it in a note at its first occurrence in **each work**. The English word misleads on its own and Penn explains it only once (T. p. 361 n. 12). Pilot. |
| viare; vians | to be a wayfarer; [one] on the way | The verb of *viator*; tag `g:viator`. Ruled 2026-09-28 (8 sites). |
| via / patria | the way / the homeland | *Beatitudo patrie* → "the blessedness of the homeland". Pilot. The earthly sense (one's native country) is also "homeland"; a note where it matters (*Dial.* 54.2). |
| corpus Christi misticum | the mystical body of Christ | |
| mater nostra | our mother | Church as mother is the governing figure of *De ecclesia* I. |
| fides formata / informis | formed faith / unformed faith | Faith formed by charity. Pilot. |
| fides explicita / implicita | explicit faith / implicit faith | The scholastic pair (*Dial.* 28.16–17). Ruled 2026-09-28. |
| articulus fidei | article of faith | Ruled 2026-09-28 (4 sites). |
| infidelis | unbeliever; with a dative, faithless (to) | Two senses by construction. Pairs with *infidelitas*, unbelief. Ruled 2026-09-28 (10 sites). |
| sacerdotes vulgares | common priests | The adjective; kept apart from *vulgares*, "the common people". Ruled 2026-09-28 (2 sites). |
| Christicole | worshippers of Christ | Ruled 2026-09-28. |
| caritas | charity | ⛔ Never "love". *Amor* and *dilectio* → "love". The argument often turns on charity as the Holy Spirit (Lombard, *Sent.* I d.17). |
| litere fraternitatum | letters of fraternity | Friars' letters admitting a benefactor to the order's suffrages. Ruled 2026-09-28 (4 sites). |
| viantes | those on the road | The participle beside *viator* (wayfarer); kept distinct so the reader sees which word Wyclif used. Ruled 2026-10-01 (≈22 sites in *De ecclesia*; first *Eccl.* 10.12). |
| universitas fidelium | the whole body of the faithful | Ruled 2026-10-02 (*Eccl.* 37.13). |
| ecclesiastici | CONTEXTUAL: clergy / those who belong to the church | Usually the clergy; where Wyclif means every member of the church (*Eccl.* 81.4) render "those who belong to the church" and write a **C** note. Ruled 2026-10-02. |
| filii imitacionis | sons of imitation | Children of Abraham by imitating him, not by flesh. Ruled 2026-10-02 (89.27, 90.7). |

# *De eucharistia*, chapter 3, part 7: [TITLE]

## ¶1 · 77.29–78.8

> [p. 77] Ex quo videtur cum neutrum istorum potest esse sine accidente, cum tunc foret purus spiritus accidentatus, quod totum accidens sit essenciale utrique supposito, et per consequens cum omne agens naturale in agendo repatitur, videtur quod nec A nec B potest [p. 78] agere vel pati accione corporea et specialiter procreare, ymmo si capta una duricie uniformi et coextensa una mediante cum alia, et sic infinicies usque ad superficiei duriciem, qua lineantur adextra undique, videtur quod nulla armatura, ymmo infinita acucies non posset huiusmodi penetrare quod si tota gravitas esset ablata tam A quam B cum armatura predicta, quam gloriosum suppositum foret et agile.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶2 · 78.9–78.26

> [p. 78] Secundo sequitur quod omnis sensus philosophorum vel naturales eorum non sufficiunt convincere de aliqua substancia aliquam quatuor questionum, sed in istis necessitati sunt ad fidem recurrere quoad diffinicionem, distinccionem et perfeccionem specificam. In omnibus istis sunt compares idiotis. Nam iuxta dicta nullus sensus vel intellectus convincit esse quamcunque materialem substanciam, cum stante omni noticia sensitiva vel experiencia apparet compossibile et consonum quod tota universitas creata sit globus accidencium; ideo ponens talia necesse habet recurrere ad fidem scripture et supponere eius sensum; et deficiente naturali noticia questionis si est de quacunque materiali substancia, necesse est quod deficiat questio quid est et questio cuiusmodi est et questio propter quid est de quolibet assignando, quia omnes dicte tres questiones presupponunt questionem si est, que non potest naturaliter stabiliri.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶3 · 78.27–79.9

> [p. 78] Sed contra istam perfidiam arguitur quod nedum tollit omnem naturalem scienciam sed eciam omnem fidem; nam sic devians nedum tenetur sentire cum antiquis errantibus quod nullam affirmacionem cognoscunt [p. 79] sed negaciones ut quod nichil sciunt et eis similia sed tenentur habere conscienciam de asserendo vel iurando aliquid contingens praxim hominum, et periret quelibet policia vel religio christiana; nam nemo debet mentiri pro toto mundo, sed generaliter pars securior est tenenda; cum ergo nulla noticia quam habemus de materiali substancia fundatur infallibiliter in principio infallibili cognoscendo, videtur quod irregulariter debemus nullam talem asserere.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶4 · 79.10–79.23

> [p. 79] Item, de quocunque nostrum non convincitur ex fide scripture ipsum esse, nec sensus nec racio hoc convincit, ergo de quolibet tali est pie dubitandum si est et quid est, et periret noticia de examinando opera cleri, de certificando numerum claustralium et de commemorando numismata vel dona ab homine eis data; ponit enim esse quod spiritus esset nudis accidentibus copulatus; quo posito non foret talis homo, ut patet ex dictis; nec valet in isto allegare aliquod miraculum vel communem cursum nature, quia ex dubio sic loquenti ab origine mundi fuit irregulariter spiritus nudis accidentibus copulatus; et sic daretur occasio multiplicandi sectas contrarie opinantes sine conviccione notoria partis false.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶5 · 79.24–80.10

> [p. 79] Item, periret fides scripture, cum posset negari alicui persone hominis revelacionem vel noticiam huiusmodi esse datam, licet nature ex spiritu et accidente que servat equivoce idem nomen, quod nos inponimus nostris substanciis; et illa natura non foret inperfeccior propter carenciam inperfecte materialis substancie, sed quantum ad omnem operacionem [p. 80] eque perfectam; et periret omnis differencia specifica et sic species alleganda et sic scala per quam fidelis ascenderet ad Deum, cum non sit Dei boni noticie humane instabili sic sine regulari fundamento deficere vel omnem stabilitatem sensacionis tollere, et specialiter in sacramento quod est Deo proprium, in quo minime foret sensus illusio circa materialem substanciam. Ideo videtur quod non est credendum istis maniacis in hiis que sine fundamento sompniant, cum publicant se non credere sibi ipsis.

[ENGLISH]

## Loserth's side-notes (PD, verbatim; not our translation)

- 78.9: If accidents can exist alone, our senses cannot tell what anything is, nor if it is.
- 78.27: Faith would perish as well as natural knowledge.
- 79.10: It is not by Scripture that we are convinced of our own existence.
- 79.24: All test of truth would be lost, and we could have no access to God.

# *De eucharistia*, chapter 3, part 8: [TITLE]

## ¶1 · 80.11–82.8

> [p. 80] Tercio sequitur de istis possibili, quod nedum dubitanda est quidditas cuiuscunque substancie, sed concedi debet predicacio mutua cuiuslibet de quocunque, ut posito quod Deus communicet Petro sacerdoti potenciam transsubstanciandi hostiam in corpus dominicum, habeatque dyaconus suus potenciam transsubstanciandi eam in ecclesiam, et habeat subdiaconus suus potestatem transsubstanciandi ipsam in totum mundum et quamlibet eius partem, et posito quod isti tres simul incipiant et simul finiant super eadem hostia verba sua sacramentalia, et cum Deus non subtrahit potestatem conficiendi propter peccatum ministri, posito quod Deus concurrat cum quolibet istorum usque in finem perficiendo correspondenter ad potenciam illis datam; quo posito videtur quod in fine corpus Christi erit ecclesia et mundus cum qualibet sui parte, quia quodlibet istorum est res eiusdem sacramenti; et iterum cum tam ecclesia quam mundus manet secundum quamlibet sui partem, videtur quod mundus sit secundum se totum in qualibet sui parte. Et iterum videtur quod quelibet pars mundi [p. 81] potest perpetuo servari in hostia, licet corrumpatur in sui natura. Sic enim foret de corpore Christi sacerdote conficiente in sancto triduo, ipso servato in pixide. Et videtur possibilitas casus quoad Deum ex isto patescere quod eque facile foret Deo convertere panem in totum mundum sicut in corpus suum, cum tamen repugnat infinite parvitati hostie converti in corpus Christi septipedale sicut converti in totum mundum; nec plus obstat quod sint multe transsubstanciaciones sub uno hostie sacramento quam quod quelibet pars Christi tam secundum corpus quam secundum animam sit sub qualibet particula hostie consecrate; videtur enim quod panis transsubstanciatur nedum in carnem Christi et sanguinem sed in corpus et animam ac quamlibet eius partem; non enim est conversio unionis sed transitoria (ut dicit Hugo); et ad illam videtur sufficere quod succedat sub eisdem accidentibus convertendum. Ex quo videtur quod quelibet pars vini vel panis convertitur in quamlibet partem Christi, ymmo in quodlibet accidens eius absolutum, cum quodlibet tale accidens transit sub accidentibus panis et vini, et sicut concomitanter sunt anima et quelibet pars corporis Christi ad omnem punctum hostie consecrate, ita videntur concomitanter converti sicut et accidens; et pars principalis videtur habere principalem racionem conversionis, et ita videtur esse multiplex transaccidentacio sicut est multiplex transsubstanciacio. Et hoc graviter ferunt novelli baptiste signorum sentenciam dictam superius de transsubstanciacione et conversione [p. 82] Hugonis. Videtur enim quod oportet transsubstanciatum mutari; cuius mutacionis terminum oportet esse substanciam, quia aliter foret transinferioracio vel transsubieccio, sed iuxta viam predictam nec oportet panem perdere vel acquirere aliquam qualitatem sed solum respectum ad quem non est motus secundum philosophos, dum panis fit hostia consecrata.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶2 · 82.9–82.21

> [p. 82] Hic videtur quod terminus conversionis ex sinistro intellectu convertitur in venenum; potest ergo dici quod panis et vinum convertuntur principaliter in corpus Christi et sanguinem sed concomitanter et secundarie totam humanitatem Christi et quamlibet eius partem; nec panis aut vinum deterioratur sed melioratur, ad quam melioracionem est motus extense loquendo, manet namque utraque natura; sed sacramentum melioratur, cum fit sacrum, et corpus Domini est illud cui est toto animo attendendum; et hoc signatur per conversionem et transsubstanciacionem; et videtur quod in quamlibet partem humanitatis Christi potest concedi facta conversio.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶3 · 82.22–83.9

> [p. 82] Sed quantum ad verba consecracionis et intencionem colentis attinet, fit quadam principalitate conversio in corpus Christi et sanguinem et in alia concomitanter et accessorie vel confuse; et potest terminus ultra hoc quod philosophi noverunt extendi ad motum, cuius motus terminus a quo est panis nudus et terminus extrinsecus ad quem est corpus dominicum, sed terminus intrinsecus ad quem est sacramentalis sanctitas iuxta quod concedi potest extense loquendo de motu quod panis et vinum insensibiliter alterantur. Et sic ille motus dicit aggregative motus multiplices et [p. 83] multas motus materias, ut bonitatem signi, efficaciam signati et multas alias habitudines relativas; et quando dicimus quod corpus Christi non exinde movetur, loquimur equivoce et striccius tunc de motu, sicut non dicimus quod homo movetur ex hoc quod species sua diffusius multiplicatur per medium nec est michi vis de dictis institucionibus terminorum (ut patet posterius) etc.

[ENGLISH]

## Loserth's side-notes (PD, verbatim; not our translation)

- 80.11: The same words might mean all sorts of different things.
- 81.18: Since the host is converted into the whole Christ, it includes His accidents, and so there is transaccidentation as well as transsubstantiation.
- 82.9: The change is principally into the body and blood of Christ, and secondarily into the whole manhood of Christ.

# *De eucharistia*, chapter 4, part 1: [TITLE]

## ¶1 · 83.10–83.13

> [p. 83] Sed restat videndum ulterius quam efficaciam habent verba sacramentalia et quomodo corpus Christi habet non esse dimensionale sed sacramentale in signis illis absconditum.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶2 · 83.14–84.6

> [p. 83] Quantum ad verba sacramentalia, videtur quod Christus in illis loquitur figurative vel tropice, sicut prius allegatum est legem novam sub habitudine ad veterem sepius loqui. Sic enim dicit Christus quod Johannes est Helias Math. XIº, 14. Sic enim dicit Math. XIIIº, 37—40: Qui seminat bonum semen est filius hominis; ager autem est mundus; bonum vero semen sunt filii regni, zizania autem sunt filii nequam; inimicus autem qui seminavit ea est diabolus, messis vero est consummacio seculi, messores autem angeli sunt. Sicut igitur Veritas loquitur in istis parabolice ut dicit evangelium, sic videtur loqui figurative in quatuor evangeliis, scilicet Math. XXVIº, 26, Marci XIVº, 22, Luce XXIIº, 19, 20, Iᵃ Cor. XIº, 24, quando dicit panem et vinum esse corpus suum et sanguinem, sicut docet Apostolus prima Cor. XIº, 24 (ut patet [p. 84] posterius). Differencia tamen est in modis loquendi, cum unus sit tropologicus vel moralis et alius allegoricus vel sacramentalis; habet enim efficaciam faciendi corpus Christi et sanguinem esse de facto sub sacramentalibus speciebus, a quo defecerunt alie figure tam nove legis quam veteris.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶3 · 84.7–86.20

> [p. 84] Sed ulterius notandum quod sicut rex habet triplex esse in regno, scilicet situale, intencionale et potenciale, correspondenter videtur Christum habere humanitus in mundo modum essendi triplicem; habet enim in celo ubi sedet ad dextram Dei modum essendi situalem, cum ibi situatur loco per quem diffunditur coequatus. Modum autem essendi potencialem videtur habere eciam humanitus, cum sit rex regum et dominus dominancium ad quamlibet partem mundi; verumptamen (ut dicunt multorum sanctorum testimonia) non habet humanitus esse situale vel dimensionale per totum mundum, sed limitate in celo ubi ponitur, sed per totum mundum habet esse essenciale divinitus; quoad medium autem esse sunt in Christo ultra alios homines divisiones multiplices; habet autem per tantum celi per quantum multiplicatur species sui corporis esse presens intencionale quo (quantum ad corpus suum) pascuntur oculi beatorum; et ista specierum multiplicacio corporis Christi secundum naturales est striccior et secundum magicos et perspectivos diffusior; limites autem istius diffusionis expedit nobis viantibus ignorare. Sed illud credimus quod beati in celo post diem iudicii ex elongacione a corpore Christi non pacientur angustias, sed beaciores non obstante maioritate [p. 85] distancie videbunt corpus Christi oculo corporali beacius; stat enim sensibile in maiori distancia videri clarius, quanto magis in beatitudine, ubi sensualis noticia ultra presenciam sensibilis secundum aliam legem emanabit ab anima. Unde pie credimus ordinem posicionis beatorum quoad corpus Christi esse regulatissimam in qua omnes beati mutuo gaudio quietantur. Sed preter istum modum essendi intencionalem quoad humanitatem Christi videtur quod secundo alii probabiliter sunt ponendi, scilicet modus essendi supernaturalis et modus essendi sacramentalis. Primo modo potest intelligi illud Math. ultimo 20: Ecce ego vobiscum sum omnibus diebus usque ad consumacionem seculi. Cum enim secundum fidem scripture Hebr. IIº, 17 Christus sit frater noster, videtur quod spectat caritati sue quod sit saltem in mente cum fratribus iuxta illud Math. XVIIIº, 20: Ubi duo vel tres congregati sunt in nomine meo, ibi sum ego in medio eorum. Si enim secundum evangelium Apostoli conversacio apostolorum in terra viancium est in celis (ut dicitur Phil. IIIº, 20, et a sanctis exponitur), evidencius anima Christi est cum fratribus quibus afficitur. Sic enim legitur IV. Reg. Vº, 26 de Elizeo multum distante a Gezi et Naaman: Nonne cor meum in presenti erat, quando reversus est homo de curru suo in occursum tui? Talia sunt multa dicta et argumenta ex quibus tam fideles quam infideles convincunt quod anima hominis est nedum ubi afficitur, sed eciam ubi a Deo ponitur ad aliquid singulariter cognoscendum. Modus autem essendi sacramentalis licet varietur in Christo secundum [p. 86] distinccionem sacramentorum, tamen specialiter est in hostia consecrata, quia omnes quatuor evangeliste Matthaeus, Marcus, Lucas et Paulus commemorant quomodo Christus dixit panem et vinum esse corpus suum et sanguinem; que locucio ex solempnitate loquentis et circumstancie captate ac testimonio sanctorum oportet quod habeat aliquam insolitam efficaciam ultra alia signa novi vel veteris testamenti; nam crux muta, benediccio laycalis et alia signa que facimus, sed specialiter in die Parasceues, significant atque commemorant corpus Christi et sanguinem. Sed magister optimus et Cesar semper Augustus in cena ultima qua prandebat vians cum suis apostolis, post esum pure figuralem agni paschalis introduxit sollempniter hoc sacramentum; ex quo patet, cum oportet Christum meliorando procedere, quod hoc sacramentum sit efficacius et rei sacramenti propinquius quam sacramenta antiqua. Aliter enim non foret racio quare illa cessarent novo non excedente superflue introducta.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶4 · 86.21–87.28

> [p. 86] Nec dubium fideli quin Christus reliquit istud ut sacramentum sacerdotibus celebrandum, quia Luce XXIIº, 19 mandat generaliter episcopis scole sue: Hoc facite in meam commemoracionem. Cum ergo figure corporis Christi in lege veteri profuerunt suis servantibus ad salutem (ut patet prima Cor. Xº), videtur quod oportet figuram novam huiusmodi corporis ipsas excedere; quod foret efficax et consonum scripture ponere in presencia corporis et sanguinis figurati, cum humanitas Christi sit quodammodo in aliis sacramentis, ergo multo magis in isto, cum verba huiusmodi sacramenti efficaciter illud vocant; et hoc confirmant facta discipulorum Christi memoriam eius in [p. 87] isto sacramento celebrancium, sentencie sanctorum doctorum de fundacione istius sacramenti ex verbis scripture scribencium et multiplices leges ecclesie. Unde dicitur communiter quod hoc sacramentum excedit alia in hiis tribus: Primo quod, ubi alia sacramenta multum distant a re sacramenti tam loco quam tempore, hoc sacramentum habet rem suam tam loco quam tempore concomitantem. Nam agnus paschalis legis veteris (de quo Exodi XIIº) multum distitit loco et tempore a corpore Christi; hoc autem sacramentum habet totam humanitatem Christi necessario comitantem. Secundo ubi alie figure veteris testamenti defecerunt ab efficacia conficiendi concomitanciam rei sacramenti, figura huius rei habet efficaciam efficienter causandi non corpus Christi sed quandam eius presenciam sacramentum sensibile concomitantem; unde non solum verba sed panis et vinum cum suis accidentibus dicuntur coniunctim et divisim sacramentum corporis Christi, et sic quamvis omnia ista sint unum sacramentum, tamen sunt valde multa sacramenta, que omnia reducuntur, ut spiritus aqua et sanguis, ad unum in effectu. Unde hoc sacramentum quoad eius permanenciam cum comitancia rei sue excedit sacramenta alia legis nove. Et tercio videtur quod hoc sacramentum excedit alia nedum quoad graciam unionis membrorum ecclesie cum Christo, sed rite celebratum prodest ministranti super alia sacramenta.

[ENGLISH]

## Loserth's side-notes (PD, verbatim; not our translation)

- 83.10: The force of the sacramental words and the nature of Christ's presence.
- 83.14: In the sacramental words Christ speaks figuratively, but with a special efficacy not found in other figurative speech.
- 84.7: Three kinds of presence: local, intentional, potential. Christ's local being is in heaven, His potencial being throughout the world, of which He is Lord. His intentional being is manifold: visible, to the saints in heaven;
- 85.10: supernatural, as with the faithful assembled in His name;
- 85.30: sacramental, specially in the host.
- 86.4: The solemnity of the words of institution shew the exceptional efficacy of this sacrament.
- 86.21: Christ ordered His priests to celebrate this sacrament, which must therefore exceed the figures of the old law.
- 87.4: It excels others in three points: 1. in the actual presence of the res sacramenti;
- 87.12: 2. in its unfailing efficacy to produce the concomitance of the res sacramenti;
- 87.24: 3. in not only uniting the members of the Church with Christ, but also in profiting the minister.
