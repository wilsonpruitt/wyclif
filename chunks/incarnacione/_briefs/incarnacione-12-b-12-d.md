# Translation brief: incarnacione 12-b–12-d

You translate these 3 chunk(s) of Wyclif's *Tractatus de benedicta incarnacione* in a single pass. Everything you need is in this file:
the working card, the glossary rows these chunks use, and for each chunk its scaffold and the editor's
apparatus for its pages. Work so as to use few tool calls:

1. Read this brief once (it is the only file you need to read, unless the card names one for your chunk).
2. For each chunk, write the COMPLETE chunk file ONCE with the Write tool to its path (given in the chunk's
   header below): the scaffold with `status: translated`, the title, the English after every Latin block,
   headings and side-notes as the card says, Notes, and Transcription notes, in the card's
   layout. Never alter the Latin. Do not make a series of small edits.
3. Use the apparatus given here for variants (the card's rule: a variant that gives the sense is translated
   with a T note citing the siglum; otherwise translate the print and flag it). Open a plate image only if a
   word cannot be construed at all from the print plus the apparatus; otherwise flag it as a Latin doubt.
4. Scripture: quote the Douay-Rheims as you know it. At the END, check every reference you quoted in ONE
   command: `cd /Users/wilsonpruitt/wyclif && .venv/bin/python scripts/w3/bible.py "Ref 1" "Ref 2" ...` and fix any wording
   that differs, in the same chunk file (this is the one allowed round of edits).
5. Run `cd /Users/wilsonpruitt/wyclif && .venv/bin/python scripts/w3/lint.py chunks/incarnacione/wyc-incarnacione-12-b.md chunks/incarnacione/wyc-incarnacione-12-c.md chunks/incarnacione/wyc-incarnacione-12-d.md` once and fix what it reports.
6. Final message: per chunk, the ledger rows (table: id | chunk / note | claim | status | how / next step),
   glossary proposals, Latin doubts, and a one-line note of anything the coordinator must decide.

Standing rules (from the *De ecclesia* briefs, 2026-10-02):
- Do NOT search the Patrologia or other sources; a separate checker verifies them afterwards. Give the
  editor's reference, the modern form in the English, and "to be checked" with a fresh LEDGER id per item
  (never reuse an id).
- Notes open with their bold class codes, `**S/C.**`, never bare letters mid-note. No process words in
  the notes ("the report", "the coordinator", "brief").
- OCR scars (stray English or margin letters, line numbers read as words, glued or broken words,
  numerals read as letters) stay out of the chunk: translate the print's word and list each scar in your
  final message only (page.line, token, likely print reading). The coordinator fixes the Latin.
- Flag every place the established Latin may have LOST a word (it does not construe, especially at a page
  head or foot) or DOUBLED one: page.line and the suspicion. Translate the print as it stands; supply a
  missing word only in brackets with a T note. The editor's print governs; list any departure.


## The working card

# TRANSLATOR CARD — one *De benedicta incarnacione* chunk

This card replaces reading CONVENTIONS, the pilot and Thakkar in full: it is their working core.
Adapted from `chunks/potestate-pape/CARD.md` (2026-10-21), for the first volume whose Latin was
established by blind transcription (B+) and the first early, purely scholastic one. Read it, then
`GLOSSARY.md`, then your scaffold (or your brief, which carries all three). Consult CONVENTIONS.md only
when the card sends you there. Work in `~/wyclif`. Wyclif is approached with **daggers drawn**: the most
recent English versions were "worse than useless" because of four error classes (below). Your English
must survive a hostile reader with the Latin open.

## Work lean (cost is per tool call: each call re-sends your whole context)

1. One call reading what you need (the brief, or CARD + GLOSSARY + scaffold).
2. **One** `bible.py` call with every scripture reference you need (it takes many refs).
3. Plates **only** for a Latin doubt the print plus apparatus cannot settle.
4. Write each finished chunk in **one** Write of the whole file (Latin blocks copied unchanged).
5. Lint once; fix; done. Draft in your head, not in the file.

## The volume

*Tractatus de benedicta incarnacione*, ed. Edward Harris (Wyclif Society, 1886), from the plates of
archive.org `latinworks03wycl` (**leaf = page + 39**; leaf images in `text/incarnacione/raw/leaves/`).
An **early** work: Harris (preface §II) puts it before 1367, in the first years of Wyclif's doctorate
(1363–67), with cross-references to *De universalibus*; the Oriel manuscript's medieval catalogue calls
it *super sententias*, and it sits in a volume of Sentences commentaries. It is the surviving text
closest to Wyclif's lost lectures on book III of the *Sentences*: **the theologian of the schools, not
yet the reformer**. No pope, no endowment, no friars: the whole treatise is the metaphysics of the
incarnation argued against the "modern doctors" (Ockham and the *moderni*), in the forms of the
disputation. A prologue and thirteen chapters; the prologue (pp. 1–2) describes each chapter in one
sentence, and Harris repeats that sentence at the chapter's head (below).

**Sigla** (Harris, preface §III): **A** Vienna 384 (the base of Beer's collation; *Prologus magistri
Johannis de Incarnacione* in red); **B** Vienna 404; **C** Vienna 387 (A, B, C one recension from a common
source, Beer); **O** Oriel College, Oxford, xv (c. 1400, English, two columns; Harris: "the best, as
probably the oldest", nearer C than A or B); **M** London, BL Royal 7 B. iii (15th c.; not a copy but
a **summary** made from a manuscript: the main course of the argument with the illustrations and
authorities left out; collated by F. D. Matthew). Cite variants with these sigla. Harris's text is
**eclectic**: "the best reading" chosen from all five, every rejected reading of A B C O at the foot
(the countless *ille/iste* swaps and trivial word-order variants excepted); the manuscripts' spelling
kept "even when manifestly incorrect" (*methaphisica*, *anthitesis*, *dyabolus*). The chapter breaks are
Wyclif's (the prologue); **the paragraphs are Harris's own** ("on my own responsibility, often a matter
of doubt": only chapters begin a new line in O).

**The page foot** (in your brief as "apparatus", by page) is keyed by **footnote figures**, which stand
in the Latin as superscripts on the word before them (`Prelibato¹ tractatu`): `1 Litera initialis (P) om.
A B C. 3 mesterium O.` From 01-b on it is **read from the plate** (`text/incarnacione/foot/`, 2026-10-22),
not OCR: trust its letters; a `[?]` or `CHECK:` line in it is a doubt to settle on the plate foot. The
figures are the editor's, not text: **never carry them into the English**; cite a variant by its page.line.
**Apparatus discipline** (first-chunk review, 2026-10-22: three of its four errors):
(i) **match a variant to its figure** in the Latin before citing it (a figure *n* belongs to the word
before ^n, not to a nearby word that resembles the variant); (ii) the foot's abbreviations are
**rejected readings, to be expanded** in the note (*ppcones* = *proposiciones*), never "beyond certain
reading"; (iii) where Harris prints **one manuscript (usually O, or M) against A B C** on a word the
argument turns on, write a **T** note giving both, even though the print is kept; (iv) a reading the
English follows that is not the print's is a departure: T note, always.

**Harris's margin and brackets.** Harris prints a running English abstract of the whole treatise down
the margin (≈21,500 words). It is **not reproduced** in this edition (Wilson, 2026-10-21): the headnote
says so once, and no chunk carries side-notes. At each chapter head he prints, in square brackets, the
prologue's Latin sentence for that chapter followed by his own English summary. The scaffold gives that
bracket as its own ¶ block (marked by a comment): **translate the Latin sentence only**, in square
brackets, worded as the prologue renders it, with **the chapter as subject ("it")**, not Wyclif ("he");
**drop Harris's English** (it is the editor's, like the margin). Its terms are tagged like any other
(a first occurrence in the bracket is the chunk's first occurrence). Write no note on the bracket.

## The job

The Latin in your scaffold is **established and frozen** (blind transcription, checked word by word
against Fordham and a five-scan vote; residue read on the plate). Fill `[TITLE]` (short, lower case:
"that Christ is a creature: the sense of the fathers"), each `[ENGLISH]`, the notes and the transcription
notes; set `status: translated`; lint; report.

- **Headings:** keep `## ¶k · range` exactly. **Never change a range; never split a paragraph.**
- **Never alter the Latin.** A transcription error you find (a stray mark, a broken word) is REPORTED,
  never repaired in your file: the coordinator repairs the transcription (`text/incarnacione/bt/pNNN.txt`)
  and refreshes the chunk's Latin. A word that looks wrong: read the apparatus for that line first;
  then, if still doubtful, the plate (`text/incarnacione/raw/leaves/nLEAF.jpg`, LEAF = page + 39
  padded to four digits: p. 3 = `n0042.jpg`). A variant that gives the sense → translate it + **T**
  note citing the siglum; a compelling emendation → translate it + **T** note "(our emendation)";
  neither → translate the print and flag it. Never smooth nonsense into sense. ⛔ **In this volume the manuscripts
  outrank Harris** (Wilson, 2026-10-22: Harris is less trusted than Loserth). Where the manuscripts agree
  **against** the print (all of A B C O, or a majority backed by the source Wyclif quotes: the Vulgate, a
  father's text), translate the manuscripts unless their reading will not construe; Harris's own
  emendations against every manuscript are set aside on the same terms. T note: "*X*, with A B C O,
  against the print's *Y*". Otherwise the print stands: a single manuscript's reading (M's above all, a
  summary) never outweighs it without cause; **the source Wyclif quotes, read and agreeing with that
  manuscript, is cause** (*In III Sent.* "d. 22", O + Bonaventure against the print's "12", 49.4). **Families:** A B C are one recension (Beer), so A B C alone against the print and O is one witness, not
  a majority; agreement **across the families** (O with any of A B C) against the print is what outranks it
  (A C O against B, 65.11). An argument that fails without a manuscript's reading is cause as well (O, 61.22). A **spelling-only** variant the rule adopts (*volucionibus*) changes no English and needs no T note. Every departure gets a T note giving both readings. ⚠ Harris is a 19th-century editor of a
  14th-century schoolman: where the print is grammatical but the argument fails, suspect the editor's
  choice among variants before Wyclif's logic, and read the apparatus.
- **English layout:** `[N]` at the same word as `[p. N]` in the Latin (the chunk's first `[p. N]` is
  implicit). Supplied words in `[brackets]`, sparingly, ⛔ **never in italics** (italic emphasis passes a
  supplied word off as Latin). **Quotations** in quotation marks. Your brief
  carries Harris's **italic runs** per page (from the scan's OCR, rough, ⚠ page numbers drift: a run not in your page's Latin belongs to another page; his quotation bounds and the
  words he took for titles or Greek). They are the editor's judgement, not the manuscript's: follow them
  by default, depart where the source shows otherwise (say so in a note). Reviews do not check
  quotation bounds against the italics. Italicised scripture inside indirect speech is quoted too; where
  quoting would garble the sentence, leave it unquoted and give the reference in an **S** note.
- **Formulae of the disputation** (ruled 2026-10-01; fixed renderings, **tagged only where GLOSSARY has
  a row**), rendered the same way throughout:
  *instatur* "it is objected" · *obicitur* "it is objected" · *arguitur* "it is argued" (with *per*:
  GLOSSARY) · *dicitur* "it is said" (in an answer: "the answer is") · *respondetur* "the reply is" ·
  *conclusio* "conclusion" · *antecedens / consequens* "antecedent / consequent" · *consequencia*
  "inference", ⛔ never "consequence" · *patet* "it is clear" · *supponitur* "it is supposed" (a premiss
  laid down) · *probatur* "proof:" or "it is proved" · *confirmatur* "this is confirmed" (⛔ not "it is
  confirmed"). *Ex fide* is the formula "as faith teaches" **only when no verb governs *ex*** (*ut ex fide
  supponitur* "as is supposed from faith").
- **Citation formulae:** *ubi supra / ubi super* "in the place cited above" (a reference back to a work
  already cited, ⛔ never a claim about where a passage stands), *ut supra* "as above", *infra* "below".
  *Utrobique* "on both sides / in both places", ⛔ not "everywhere" (*ubique*).

## The four error classes (Thakkar) — check every sentence

1. **Terms:** GLOSSARY.md governs, one term one rendering. Tag the **first occurrence in the chunk**
   of every §A–C term: `[quiddity]{g:quiditas}`. The key must exist in GLOSSARY.md. A term that looks
   technical but has no row: render it sensibly, untagged, and propose it in your report.
   **CONTEXTUAL** rows hold two senses English splits: choose by context and write a **C** note at
   the first occurrence in the chunk and wherever it leans to the other sense (the dikaiosune rule,
   CONVENTIONS §6).
   ⚠ **This volume's terms are the metaphysics of the incarnation**, and the GLOSSARY, built on the
   political works, has few of them. The rulings that exist: *ens / esse / essencia* "a being / being /
   essence" (⚠ *esse* is ambiguous, note when it matters) · *universale* "universal" · *simpliciter /
   secundum quid* "without qualification / in a certain respect" (⛔ always opposable) · *differencia*
   "difference" · *subiectum* "subject" · *predicamentum* "category" · *racio* (against *substancia*)
   "aspect" · *successivum / permanens* "successive / permanent entity" · *ampliacio* "ampliation" ·
   *sumitur pro* "is taken for" · *dicitur multipliciter* "is said in many ways" · *quiditas* "quiddity".
   **Ruled from the first chunk (2026-10-22, Wilson; GLOSSARY §C, end): tag only**, with a G note only
   for something specific to the passage (⛔ never a note that restates the row): *humanitas* "the
   humanity" · *incommunicantes* "that do not communicate" · *dimittere / dimissio* "lay aside / the
   laying-aside" · *assumere / assumpcio* "assume / assumption" (⚠ apart from the logician's *assumptum*,
   C note where that sense occurs) · *homo assumptus* "the assumed man" · *triduum* "the three days" ·
   *ydemptitas specifica* "identity of species" · *Verbum* "the Word", pronoun **"he"** · *deitas* "the
   Godhead" · *natura* "nature" · *persona* "person" · *creatura / creator / creatus* · *posicio /
   proposicio / predicacio* "position / proposition / predication" (kept apart) · *verificari de* "be
   true of" · *sacramentum* "sacrament" (G note "= mystery") vs *misterium* "mystery" · *moderni
   doctores* "the modern doctors" · *sancti* "the saints" · *probabiles doctores* "reputable doctors" vs *approbati doctores* "approved doctors" ·
   *Magister* "the Master" · *declarare* "make clear" vs *ostendere* "show" · *epilogus* "recapitulation"
   · *infirmitas* "weakness" · *habitudo* CONTEXTUAL "condition / respect".
   For the rest, **render consistently within your brief and PROPOSE the row** (the coordinator rules
   between briefs). Expect: *suppositum*, *ypostasis*, *res communis* (the common thing), *individuum*,
   *singulare*, *unire / unio*, *communicacio ydiomatum*, *materia prima*, *forma*, *compositum*,
   *symbolum* (the creed; has a row). Render *homo* "man" (the medieval *homo* that *Christus est homo*
   needs; never "human being" in the formulae).
   Key rulings carried from the political works that still apply: *ecclesia* church (**lower-case**)
   · *caritas* charity · *viator* wayfarer · *ex fide* as faith teaches · *sentencia* teaching ·
   *opinio* opinion · *evidencia* evidence · *fides* faith.
2. **Connectives carry the argument.** ⛔ Never omit one, never turn one into filler.

   | Latin | English | Never |
   |---|---|---|
   | enim, nam | for | "now", "indeed" |
   | ergo, igitur, ideo | therefore, so, then | "now", "and", "indeed" |
   | sed / autem, marking the **minor premiss or next step** | now | (omitted) |
   | sed / autem, adversative | but | (omitted) |
   | autem, continuative | and | (omitted), and **not "now"** |
   | cum (concessive / causal) | although / since | "whenever" |
   | tamen | yet, nevertheless | "therefore" |
   | item | again, also | "now" |
   | vero (continuative) | and; but (adversative) | "now", "truly" |
   | verumtamen | nevertheless | "but truly" |
   | unde | hence, so | "whence" (archaic), "where" |
   | per idem | by the same token | "in the same way" |
   | ymmo | indeed, rather (correcting upward) | (omitted) |
   | patet; constat | it is clear; it is evident | |

   "Now" is reserved for the minor premiss, or the step that brings a new premiss to bear. An *autem*
   that only extends the same step is "and". ⚠ The commonest error in *De ecclesia* (close-out, ~50 of
   69 connective fixes): a *sed* that brings the minor premiss of a syllogism closed by *ergo / ideo /
   igitur* rendered "but". Before writing "but" for a *sed*, look ahead for the *ergo*: if one follows,
   it is "now". This volume is syllogism on syllogism: the rule will be tested in every paragraph.
3. **Ordinary words with a medieval sense:** GLOSSARY §D; look up any word whose classical and
   Wyclifite senses may differ, and propose additions.
4. **Syntax:** construe before rendering (main verb, subject, what every relative and genitive
   hangs on). Keep quantifier order where it is meaning (*omnis natura*, *nulla creatura*). Keep
   Wyclif's long periods where English tolerates them. **A doubtful construal is never chosen
   silently:** translate the likelier reading and write a **C** note giving the alternative.
   ⚠ **Predication is the matter here, not just the form.** *Christus est creatura*, *humanitas est
   Christus*, *Verbum est homo*: Wyclif argues about what is predicated of what, with supposition and
   identity in play. Keep subject and predicate in his order, keep *est* as "is" (never "exists" unless
   the Latin is *existit* or the sense is plainly existential, with a C note), and keep *secundum* ("as
   to", "according to") visible, in its place: *secundum deitatem / humanitatem* "as to the Godhead / as
   to the humanity". Reduplicative ***secundum quod*** "insofar as", ⛔ never "in that" (heard as
   "because"). ⛔ **Never supply "as God / as man"** where the Latin has bare apposition (*ipse Deus*) or
   bare predication: the difference between the bare and the reduplicated form is the treatise's matter.
   **Propositions in indirect speech:** where an accusative + infinitive names a proposition whose sense
   is under discussion (*intelligentes Christum non esse creaturam*), render it as the quoted proposition
   ("who understand 'Christ is not a creature'"), not "understand that …", which asserts it.

## Scripture

`python3 scripts/w3/bible.py "Ioh 10:30"` (Vulgate + Douay–Rheims; psalms in Vulgate numbering) or
`python3 scripts/w3/bible.py --find "ego et Pater unum sumus"`. Where Wyclif's Latin agrees with the
Clementine Vulgate, use the **Douay–Rheims wording**. Where he departs, translate *his* Latin and write
an **S** note giving the Vulgate. Modern references in the English (John 10:30). The chapter numbers
are Wyclif's, the verse numbers Harris's margin references where he gives them and ours where he does
not; psalms in Vulgate numbering (Harris's margin uses the Hebrew: Ps. cx = 109). The headnote says so once.

## Notes

- `[^n]` from 1, the marker placed in the same edit as its note, each opening with a type letter **with a full stop** (`**C.**`; the site strips only that form):
  **T** text · **C** construal · **G** glossary (passage-specific only; otherwise a tag) · **S** source ·
  **R** reception/context (e.g. a manuscript's marginal note that Harris prints, CONVENTIONS §4; O's
  reader marks *nota bonam rationem*).
- **Density: about one note per 70–100 Latin words**, fewer where the text is plain. Short, factual,
  says what the Latin does and stops. No modern theology, no evaluation.
- **Every identification** other than scripture checked with bible.py gets a ledger row in your
  report with a status: `editor` (Harris's source reference at the page foot or in the margin),
  `to-verify` (from memory: every patristic or scholastic identification you did not read in this
  session), `verified` (you read the source text this session: say where; local PL at
  `~/patrologia/sources/pl/tei/`). ⛔ Never pass memory off as verified. Id `I<chunk>-<n>` (`I01b-1`; ⚠ `I`, since `P` is *De potestate pape*),
  cited in the note: "(LEDGER I01b-1)". The *sancti* cited are above all Augustine (*De Trinitate*,
  *Enchiridion*, *De fide et symbolo*), Anselm (*Cur Deus homo*, *De incarnatione Verbi*), Damascene,
  Hilary, the Lombard (*Sent.* III) and Grosseteste; the *moderni* are usually unnamed. Harris's index (`sources/ia-ocr/latinworks03wycl.txt`, near l. 23680) lists his identifications of Wyclif's own works (*De Trinitate*, *De adnichilacione* …). ⚠ Thomas's "many men" (one person with several humanities; ch. 12) is the *Scriptum super Sent.* III d. 1 q. 2 a. 5, ⛔ not *ST* III q. 3 a. 7, which concludes "one man" (LEDGER Iprol-3). ⚠ Wyclif counts the Maximinus works as **three books** "contra Maximinianum": his book 1 = the *Collatio cum Maximino* (PL 42, 709–42), books 2–3 = *Contra Maximinum* I–II (his "book 3, c. 22" = II.22); his quotations from book 1 may be Maximinus speaking, not Augustine (LEDGER I01a-9, I02b-4, I02c-5). ⚠ Wyclif's chapter numbers for Anselm's *De incarnatione Verbi* run **one above Migne's** from c. 6 on (his "6" = Migne V = Schmitt 10; his "7" = Migne VI = Schmitt 11; his "1" = Schmitt 1 = Migne II): give Wyclif's number and the modern one, "c. 7 in Wyclif's numbering (Schmitt c. 11; PL 158, c. VI)" (LEDGER I09a-1).

## Model of register

`pilots/wyc-ecclesia-01a.md` (De ecclesia pp. 1–5) is a reviewed model of register and note style:
read it for that only (it predates some GLOSSARY rulings; **GLOSSARY governs**). **Chunk `prol`**
carries the `## Headnote` (CONVENTIONS §12 order: occasion, text, the work's move, where it is
answered; date, editor, sigla, the margin abstract not reproduced, the bracketed arguments), each
unverified claim marked `[verify]`.

## Side-notes

None in this volume (above). Nothing to place, nothing to report.

## Finish

1. `status: translated` in the front matter (nothing else changes there).
2. `.venv/bin/python scripts/w3/lint.py chunks/incarnacione/<your chunk>.md` until clean.
3. The four-class check above, sentence by sentence.
4. ⛔ Edit **only your chunk(s)**. No git, no other files. Everything shared goes in your report.

## Report (≤ 200 words per chunk, exactly these heads)

- **Chunk:** id, Latin words, notes.
- **Ledger rows:** in LEDGER.md's table format `| id | chunk / note | claim | status | how / next step |`.
- **Glossary proposals:** Latin · proposed English · where · why.
- **Latin doubts:** page.line · printed · suspicion · settled on the plate?

## Glossary (the 329 rows these chunks use; the full file is GLOSSARY.md)

# GLOSSARY — FROZEN 2026-09-28 (Wilson's pilot review)

*One Latin term, one English rendering, every time, across the whole corpus. A reader must be able
to recognise the same word coming back, because Wyclif's arguments turn on it. A rendering changes
only by a dated decision in CONVENTIONS' decision log, never silently in a chunk. Entries may be
*added* by recorded decision as new terms appear. **Tag keys:** a chunk tags a term as
`[English]{g:latin-form}` (CONVENTIONS §11), and the key must match a Latin form in one of the rows
below. These rows are also the source of the site's hover glossary. Where a term has two senses,
the entry says so and each chunk's note picks one. A term marked **CONTEXTUAL** holds together
senses English splits: its English is chosen by context, under the dikaiosune rule (CONVENTIONS §6).*

**Sources of the decisions.** "Pilot" = settled in `pilots/` this session. "T. p. N" = Mark
Thakkar, "Duces caecorum," *Vivarium* 58 (2020), page N (`reference/`), which documents the
errors of the two most recent translations. His corrections are adopted here unless an entry says
otherwise.

**Orthography.** Headwords are given in the Society editions' medieval spelling (*eciam*,
*racio*, *quiditas*, *ymmo*), because that is what the translator will meet on the page.

---

## A. The church

| Latin | English | Note |
|---|---|---|
| pars peregrinans; peregrinari | the pilgrim part; to be a pilgrim | Augustine's *peregrinatio* (Ench. 56). Pilot. |
| predestinatus, -i | the predestinate (sg. "a predestinate [person]") | Never "the elect", which is *electi* and gets "the elect". |
| prescitus, -i | **the foreknown** | ⭐ Wyclif's technical term for those God foreknows will be damned. It is **not** "the reprobate" (*reprobi* → "the reprobate"). Explain it in a note at its first occurrence in **each work**. The English word misleads on its own and Penn explains it only once (T. p. 361 n. 12). Pilot. |
| via / patria | the way / the homeland | *Beatitudo patrie* → "the blessedness of the homeland". Pilot. The earthly sense (one's native country) is also "homeland"; a note where it matters (*Dial.* 54.2). |
| corpus Christi misticum | the mystical body of Christ | |
| mater nostra | our mother | Church as mother is the governing figure of *De ecclesia* I. |
| Christicole | worshippers of Christ | Ruled 2026-09-28. |
| litere fraternitatum | letters of fraternity | Friars' letters admitting a benefactor to the order's suffrages. Ruled 2026-09-28 (4 sites). |
| capitaneus | captain | Kept apart from *caput* "head": Wyclif grants the pope captaincy and denies him headship. Ruled 2026-10-01 (*Eccl.* 17.13, 19.21–24, 22.8). |
| universitas fidelium | the whole body of the faithful | Ruled 2026-10-02 (*Eccl.* 37.13). |

## B. Lordship, law, office

| Latin | English | Note |
|---|---|---|
| dominium civile / naturale / evangelicum | civil / natural / evangelical lordship | |
| magnates | magnates | Ruled 2026-09-28. |
| capitalis dominus; tenere de | chief lord; to hold of | Feudal tenure language, kept literal: the lords "hold of Christ as chief lord". Pilot (Dialogus 2.19). |
| ius | right / law | ⚠ Two senses (subjective right vs. body of law). The chunk's note picks one wherever it matters. |
| lex dei / lex Christi / lex evangelica | God's law / the law of Christ / the gospel law | |
| deitas / divinitas | the Godhead / divinity | Kept distinct; B reads *divinitatis* at *Dial.* 2.13. |

# *De benedicta incarnacione*, chapter 12, part 2: [TITLE]

## ¶1 · 205.25–206.3

> [p. 205] Sed contra illud tripliciter arguitur.⁷ Primo posito quod duo corpora coextendantur et utrumque simul pro eodem loco et tempore gradiatur, videtur quod sunt duo motus progressivi,⁸ sicut due quantitates et cetera accidencia coextensa. Oppositum tamen videtur, cum motus individuatur sufficienter a spacio, tempore, et subiecto; sed idem est homo in numero, idem tempus et spacium; ergo cum nulla pars quantitativa hominis graditur, eadem est mocio progressiva. Et per idem posito quod secundum unam humanitatem [p. 206] penetraret progrediendo multas continuas humanitates¹ quiescentes continue,² idem Christus simul et semel secundum idem quiesceret,² et motu contrario moveretur.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶2 · 206.4–207.10

> [p. 206] Similiter iuxta illud sequitur quod Christus infinitum bonum animal potest esse, quia mensura bonitatis rei composite capitur a principiis intrinsecis cum disposicionibus formalibus in eadem. Ex quo sequitur quod Christus racione multitudinis humanitatum foret melior homo quam si solum unam assumeret. Patet consequencia, supposito primo quod Christus sit tantum finite bonus iuxta illam vocem Veritatis, ‘Pater maior me est,’ Ioh. 14.³ Ymo si foret infinitum bonus homo racione deitatis, foret per idem infinitum antiquus, et per consequens primus homo, consequens contra Apostolum prima ad Cor. 15. ‘primus, inquit, homo de terra terrenus, et secundus homo de celo celestis.’ Et ita oportet limitare in Christo omnia alia⁴ accidencia, que habet humanitus, sic quod non infinitum bonum corpus vel animam habet Christus; et per idem non infinitum magnus senex vel antiquus homo est Christus, nec infinitum potens ac virtuosus vel sciens homo, quia sic excederet limites speciei eciam secundum hominem assumptum; et per consequens non conveniret nobiscum in specie; que contradicunt supradictis. Quo supposito patet quod Christus existens bonus homo racione unius humanitatis foret melior homo racione alterius humanitatis incommunicantis coassumpte; cum bonitatem magnam acquireret nullam aliunde deperdens. Nec superest in quo per humanitatem melioraretur⁵ nisi in esse hominis. Et per idem foret in duplo melior homo per assumpcionem duarum humanitatum quam per assumpcionem unius solummodo; et sic de aliis denominacionibus accidentalibus⁶ consequentibus ad easdem. Ex quo videtur primo quod infinitas humanitates assumendo foret eque bonus homo ut Deus, vel unum infinitum foret reliquo maius. Videtur 2ᵈᵒ [p. 207] quod infinitum melior potest¹ esse asinus quam homo, posito quod infinitas naturas asininas Verbum assumeret naturam hominis dimittendo. Et per consequens sequitur 3° quod species non assimilatur numeris, cum omnis creata substancia magis et minus susciperet² ut unus homo³ esset⁴ reliquo in duplo magis homo propter humanitatem duplicem; et sic de qualibet proporcione racionali reali;⁵ et per consequens Christus racione multitudinis naturarum excederet in humanitate quodcunque aliud individuum speciei.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶3 · 207.11–208.5

> [p. 207] 3° videtur quod ex omni genere accidentis corporei potest esse composicio parcium intensive. Nam coextensis humanitatibus secundum materias possent partes quantitative materierum et suorum accidencium coextendi; et per consequens, cum omnia sunt forme vel materie eiusdem suppositi, sequitur quod per talem composicionem posset unum componi non extensive; ergo intensive; quod est impossibile. Et [sic]⁶ de materia et ceteris accidentibus, que secundum philosophos⁷ non possunt magis vel minus suscipere. Nam eque magnus foret Christus secundum unam humanitatem, sicut⁸ foret⁹ Christus secundum⁹ infinitas equales insimul coextensas. Nec sapit quod Christus sit intensius septipedalis quam prius. Et hic videtur possibile¹⁰ quod infinitum magnus iam est Christus, et nullam quantitatem deperdet, et tamen in fine erit solum septipedalis, posito quod infinitas humanitates equales assumat ad modum coree¹¹ iuxta positas; sic¹² quod omnes ille sese penetrantes coextendantur in fine sine augmentacione¹³ vel diminucione; et patet conclusio. Et sic infinitum magnum potest continue maiorari continue adquirendo quantitatem ac nullam penitus deperdendo quousque infinitum parvum fuerit, ut alibi declaratur. Et conformis est consideracio [p. 208] de motu, ut infinitum intensus potest esse motus per motuum incommunicancium extensionem,¹ cum hoc quod mobile quantumcunque tarde ad velocissimum moveatur. Et ex istis potest calculator elicere quotlibet conclusiones nimis mirabiles, quia regularum de velocitate motuum destructivas.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶4 · 208.6–208.17

> [p. 208] Item hoc corpus et hec anima cum ista unione ypostatica et aliis que secuntur sunt sufficiencia principia ad faciendum Christum esse hominem; cum illis sive² aliis quibuscunque² positis, hoc sequatur. Sed multiplicatis completis principiis oportet multiplicari effectum formaliter consequentem. Ergo si sint multe humanitates assumpte, sunt multi homines; ut si Christus iam ad humanitatem habitam assumeret aliam humanitatem incommunicantem, illa assumpcio cum sit sufficiens principium, sufficit facere Christum iterum esse hominem; et sic quociens illa principia fuerint geminata.³ Ex quo sequitur quod si Christus multas humanitates assumeret, foret multi homines consequenter.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶5 · 208.18–208.30

> [p. 208] Confirmatur tripliciter. Primo si aliqua principia individuant Christum, ut homo potissime foret⁴ corpus et anima; et per consequens variatis illis oportet individuum hominis variari. Aliud ergo est Christum esse istum hominem ex hoc corpore et hac anima integratum, et aliud esse⁵ istam personam ex alio corpore et alia anima compositum quia aliter indubie non foret Christus aliud per humanitatis assumpcionem quam foret eternaliter, si solummodo foret Deus. Et patet sentencia sancti Thome, quod Verbum si assumeret multas humanitates ut Iohannem, Petrum et cetera, foret correspondenter multi homines. Verbum igitur esse hominem foret communis humanitas ad ipsum esse Iesum, Petrum etc.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶6 · 208.31–209.9

> [p. 208] Similiter impossibile est formas completas eciam accidentales multiplicari simul et semel, nisi eo ipso multiplicentur supposita. Sed omnis humanitas est forma, cum sit illud [p. 209] quo substancia formaliter est homo; ergo multiplicatis humanitatibus multiplicabuntur et homines. Assumptum declaratum est de formis, accidentibus, et earum substanciis proximis, ut si sint multe ambulaciones simul et semel oportet multa supposita ambulare; et ita de aliis; ergo a maiori vel pari, cum humanitas sit suppositum esse hominem non individuata ex successione temporis vel adquisicione adventicii accidentis, quod positis multis humanitatibus multi homines consecuntur.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶7 · 209.10–209.26

> [p. 209] 3°· idem patet, posito quod Verbum assumat multas embriones et post completas humanitates¹ animabus congenitis, patet quod anime advenientes, cum sint forme substanciales, faciunt Verbum esse aliud; et per consequens non relinquitur quid² aliud nisi illum hominem. Prius enim fuit completus Iesus et per consequens per posteriores animas non fit Iesus. Et si dicatur quod anime advenientes non faciunt Christum esse aliud sed alterius³ modi,³ tunc sunt forme accidentales advenientes enti in actu et non eiusdem racionis cum ceteris animabus, que in quantum⁴ huius modi, faciunt corpora animata. Patet igitur, si experiencia et principia philosophica salvari debeant, quod Verbo assumente multas humanitates est multi homines. Nam numerus hominum, qui est sensibile commune ex 2ᵈᵒ De Anima, ita patescit sensui secundum quantitates continuas dislocatas et secundum quotlibet differencias accidentales illarum naturarum, sicut innotescit aliquis sensibilis numerus alicui.

# *De benedicta incarnacione*, chapter 12, part 3: [TITLE]

## ¶1 · 209.27–211.11

> [p. 209] Item posito quod quodlibet suppositum generis animalis servatis⁵ omnibus positivis sit Verbo ypostatice copulatum; patet quod non exinde periret genus, species, vel differencia animalis; et per consequens non omne animal foret Christus; ex quo per locum a sufficienti similitudine sequitur quod Verbum assumendo multas humanitates non foret solummodo unus homo. Assumptum patet eo quod Verbum non⁶ necessitatur ex unione ypostatica corrumpere aliquod positivum; [p. 210] et, cum genus, species, et differencia sint plurimum positiva, patet quod non ex assumpcione oportet illas exstinguere; et cum non sit genus in actu nisi habeat species et illa supposita, que specifice¹ distinguantur, patet ex casu possibili illis quos alloquor² de facto posito; consequens est quod sint multa individua³ distincta specifice; non ergo omne individuum³ de genere vivencium foret Christus; maiorem enim distinccionem oportet esse individuis quam in formis communibus, cum omnia inferiora in suis communioribus uniuntur. Nec potest dici quod manet genus animalis cum suis divisivis differenciis sicut prius, cum indifferenter omnis homo sit asinus, leo, capra, et sic de aliis, si Christus non sit multa animalia racione multarum animalitatum ypostatice coniunctarum. Ubi ergo foret genus distinctum a specie vel individuo secundum communioritatem, si idem individuum cuiuslibet generis animalis sit commune cuilibet animali? Ubi eciam tunc⁴ foret differencia inter racionale et irracionale, rudibile et irrudibile⁵ et ita de ceteris,⁶ si omne animal racionale sit animal irracionale, rudibile sit irrudibile, et ita de⁶ omnibus aliis⁷ differenciis assignandis? Omnes ergo termini per se in predicamento substancie nec predicarentur in quid, nec de rebus distinctis specifice cum omne animal sit omne animal, nec forma aliqua est sufficiens medium distinguendi unum suppositum vel naturaliter⁸ ab altero eo quod species permixte de se mutuo predicantur; et cum⁹ tam species differant⁹ quam individua speciei, videtur quod ydemptificatis speciebus individua ydemptificari poterunt. Nec valet dicere quod ex assumpcione huiusmodi species corrumpuntur, quia omnis species, que prius fuit, habet omnem singularem essenciam, quam prius habuit; et Verbum nedum est suppositum hominis sed bovis, leonis, et cuiuslibet animalis. Cum ergo sufficit ad existenciam [p. 211] speciei quod unum suppositum illius nature¹ existat,² sequitur quod manet omnis species, que perante. Non enim est hic fallacia accidentis—quicquid fuerit in principio huius³ hore est modo; species leonis est⁴ aliquid quod fuit in principio⁵ illius hore; ergo omnis talis species est modo—. Et cum⁶ nulla possunt nunc plus differre et nunc minus, manencia omnino immota; sequitur quod, sicut nature per ante differebant specifice, sic et modo; et per consequens modo est species. Confirmatur ex hoc quod omnis species est natura,⁷ omnis⁷ natura animalis, que prius fuit, modo est; ergo⁸ omnis species, que prius fuit, modo est.⁸

[ENGLISH]

## ¶2 · 211.12–212.3

> [p. 211] Item Deus potest de omnibus hominibus per viam continuacionis facere unum compositum, sicut infinitum magnum et infinitum parvum potest Deus facere hominem. Quo posito⁹ videtur primo quod homo potest infinitum maiorari et alias infinitum minorari sine hoc quod quantitatem aliquam adquirat vel deperdat¹⁰; ut posito quod Verbum quotlibet humanitates seorsum assumat et omnes illas stante unione continuet, et¹¹ iterum discontinuet, secundum quod exigit conclusio probanda. Nam Christus fuit ante unionem homo medie quantitatis et post continuacionem erit monstrum grandissimum et deforme; et cum ex continuacione nulla quantitas secundum se totam adquiritur, sequitur propositum. Et idem contingit arguere de alteracione; ut potencia¹² naturali tam corporis quam anime tale quidem corpus multiplex sufficeret quantumlibet distanter sentire, et quantumlibet tarde¹³ moderando¹⁴ spacium longissimum¹⁵ in brevi¹⁴ describere. Cum ergo cuiuslibet partis illius corporis aliqua pars sit pars corporis Christi, sequitur quod hoc totum corpus sit corpus [p. 212] Christi; et per consequens Christus, postquam¹ fuit communis stature, iam est ita magnus sicut hoc corpus. Ex quo inferenda sunt alia.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶3 · 212.4–213.14

> [p. 212] 2°. videtur sequi quod Christus sit quotlibet partes sue quantitative. Nam ante continuacionem Christus fuit compositum ex qualibet istarum animarum et suo corpore; ex quo sequitur quod Christus sit multe partes quantitative. Nec valet dicere quod natura humana, et non homo, sit pars hominis; quia partes quantitative corporis² sunt substancie per se in genere, quod negatur de humanitate; ergo sicut monstrum quod est homo geminus et a dyafragmate versus superius habet hominem eius partem, sic et Christus in casu posito. Non enim desinit esse completus homo secundum illam humanitatem propter continuacionem; sicut nec inciperet esse homo secundum istam humanitatem propter discontinuacionem. Concesso autem consequente videtur primo, si Christus sit quotlibet partes sue, quod multa quorum quodlibet³ est Christus; et cum Christus non sit aliud quam homo, sequitur quod multi homines sunt Christus et non propter continuacionem; ergo ante continuacionem fuit Christus multi homines; et non, si non ex assumpcione multarum humanitatum; ergo posito quod Christus multas humanitates assumat, consequitur ipsum esse multos homines, quod est intentum. Nec valet dicere quod Christus non habet partes huiusmodi, cum ex illis denominatur magnus, agens, beatus, et sic de formis ceteris que partibus suis insunt. Et si dicatur quod omnes sunt Christus et non pars eius, sed idem cum toto, tunc restat dicere secundum quam humanitatem Christus a Deo maioratur; cum non sit possibile humanitatem aggregari ex multis humanitatibus, nisi illa a qualibet illarum differat. Et patet quod secundum nullam illarum humatatum parcialium maioratur; ergo secundum illam totalem; et per consequens est nova humanitas sine correspondenti [p. 213] anima generata; quod est impossibile; cum nec corpus organicum correspondens tali humanitati fingi poterit, nec spiritus¹ implens materiam; nec corpus est maius propter iuxtaposicionem corporis quod non incidit in partem sui. Patet itaque logicis in casu posito quod ad omnem punctum Christi est non gradus augmentacionis, cum non sit motus nisi subiectum aliquod primo moveatur. Et hoc replicatur consequenter contra hoc Euclidis principium, ‘omne totum est maius sua parte quantitativa.’ Et posito² quod Christus assumat³ omnem naturam animalis; tunc post continuacionem omnium illorum factus monstrum foret alicubi non monstrum, et sic foret multe res, et per consequens multe substancie; quia aliter non foret pars sui, nisi pars et totum ponant in numerum.

[ENGLISH]

## ¶4 · 213.15–213.28

> [p. 213] 3° potest poni casus de Dei omnipotencia quod infinitas naturas corporeas adaptet infinitis animabus, quarum prima sit dupla ad secundum,⁴ et sic in infinitum; et omnibus illis continuatis assumat quamlibet in ypostaticam unionem. Tunc videtur quod Christus sit infinite partes sue, et sic infinitum parvus, et per consequens maior seipso; et cum, ubicunque fuerit, est eque magnus racione multiplicacionis concomitancie, ut patet de eucaristia; sequitur quod in quotlibet locis est minor seipso. Ymo cum infinitas animas Deus potest producere et facere eas incommunicantes⁵ materias⁶ actuare, sequitur quod sit possibile⁷ quamlibet partem quantitativam Christi esse Christum; quod est impossibile, cum tunc non forent multe partes sui quantitative, ut tactum est superius proximo capitulo.

# *De benedicta incarnacione*, chapter 12, part 4: [TITLE]

## ¶1 · 213.29–216.7

> [p. 213] Item ex evidencia sancti Thome videtur quod Christus assumendo multas humanitates sit multi homines. Nam omne nomen appellativum, cuius principalia significata⁸ multiplicantur, predicatur⁹ vere⁹ pluraliter de eisdem. Sed hoc nomen homo primo et principaliter significat qualitatem [p. 214] substancialem ut humanitatem: ergo multiplicatis humanitatibus in Christo, et¹ homo vere predicatur pluraliter de eodem.¹ Maior ex hoc est evidens quod multiplicatis significatis multiplicanda sunt nomina significatorum; ut si tres persone divine haberent multas divinitates, tunc essent multi dii;² et sic de similibus quibuscunque. Minor autem patet ex hoc quod substancia secunda secundum Aristotelem in Predicamentis capitulo De Substancia significat quale-quid hoc est, substancialem³ qualitatem.³ Ut patet in methaphisica; homo enim principaliter significat humanitatem, album albedinem. Concesso ergo consequente et posito quod Verbum assumat omnes humanitates; consequens est quod sint multi homines ex assumpto; et cum Verbum sit omnis homo, sequitur quod Verbum sit multi homines. Negato vero assumpto de talibus concretis, sed concesso quod principaliter significant talia supposita, oportet dicere consequenter quod iste terminus homo⁴ omne quod est de sua primaria imposicione significat; et per idem quodlibet nomen appellativum vel concretum quodcunque significat.⁵ Nam omnem personam divinam homo de imposicione sua primaria significat, et cum hoc singulas creaturas; ergo conclusio. Maior patet ex hoc quod omne suppositum quod potest esse homo, signum significat; omnis persona divina potest esse homo; ergo etc. Et per idem bovem, asinum, leonem, et quamlibet speciem creature; cum omnis natura singularis huiusmodi potest a Verbo assumi stante unione personali ad hominem; quo posito de facto omnem talem naturam significaret, quia omnem hominem significaret;⁶ omnis talis species foret homo;⁶ ergo omnem talem speciem significaret; et cum nullum nomen significat universaliter formas specificas nisi eo ipso significaverit omnes formas individuas sub eis contentas, sequitur conclusio. Certum est tamen quod non fuit de intencione imponencium terminos ad significandum, [p. 215] quod iste terminus homo significaret deitatem; et ita de quolibet designando, quia tunc essent omnes tales termini analogi¹ et equivoci. Perirent eciam superioritas et inferioritas terminorum, et multi sillogismi in terminis substancialibus per fallaciam accidentis; ut sic arguendo— quicquid nascetur ex homine non eternaliter existebat; iste² homo nascetur ex homine; ergo non eternaliter existebat²; et sic de similibus. Ymo non est verisimile terminum significare philosopho illud quod nescit sibi significare, ymo quod credit non posse esse hominem. Sed constat quod gentiles philosophi assererent³ Deum non directe significari per terminos tales specificos, quia tunc concederent Deum posse⁴ esse hominem; ergo⁵ non significaverat illis Deum; et per idem nec nobis; cum univoce nobis significaret sicut illis nisi⁶ per accidens, quia contingit humanitatem esse Deum. Aliter enim cognoscerent et crederent omnes philosophi in confuso Deum fore hominem in hoc universali—omnis homo erit homo—et nunquam negarent differencias divisivas generi de se invicem predicari, ut sic—omnis homo est racionalis; asinus est homo; ergo est racionalis—. Sic enim concedunt theologi quod homo creavit mundum, quia persona Verbi, que est homo, creavit mundum. Pono itaque quod in mente philosophi ignorantis incarnacionem sit ista intencio specifica ‘homo’ naturaliter significans hominem et solum hominem. Et pono quod stante illa unione Deus assumat quamcunque naturam specificam animalis; et patet ex dictis et dicendis quod homo foret in qualibet specie animalis; et sic cum veris⁷ sequitur quod ista intencio homo continue naturaliter significans significaret asinum, leonem etc, sicut modo significat; et ita, ut arguitur in materia de ydemptificacione, quilibet terminus eque indifferenter significaret quidlibet. Quo dato non foret negandum quod homo est asinus; et sic quandocumque [p. 216] predicatur positivum de aliquo positivo, quod idem est directe significatum per predicatum et subiectum, quod sufficit ad verificandum enunciaciones huiusmodi cum paribus que ponuntur. Nec valet dicere quod nullus talis terminus naturam significat; cum sic iste terminus deus de sua intencione primaria hominem et omne assertibile significat.
